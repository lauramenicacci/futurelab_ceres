At the beginning of the programme, funding was sufficient to provide 140,000 homes with an average CAD 1070 grant. As part of the Government of Canada's 2009 Economic Action Plan, an additional CAD 300 million was invested in the programme. This allowed as many as 200,000 more homeowners to participate in the programme from 2009 - 2011. A CAD 285 million funding expansion was announced in 2010.

Energy advisors perform pre-retrofit assessments and provide a checklist of recommended upgrades, along with an EnerGuide for Houses home energy rating to the property owner, who chooses from the recommend retrofits and implements these within an 18 month time period. Energy advisors perform post-retrofit assessments, determine that retrofits have been done, and submit the grant application for the property owner. The grant is based on the total of the amounts allocated for each of the eligible retrofits. The programme is supported by stakeholders such as provincial, territorial and municipal governments and utilities who may partly subsidise the audits and/or offer complementary grants. These and other stakeholders (e.g. environmental and community groups, product suppliers and manufacturers, renovation and mechanical contractors, home inspectors, trade associations, etc.) also promote the programme.

The total volume of the support is estimated at 2 000 million SEK. The support for solar cells accounts for 100 million SEK out of this total.
