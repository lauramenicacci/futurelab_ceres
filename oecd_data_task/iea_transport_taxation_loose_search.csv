"Bonus-malus system for passenger cars, light trucks and light buses",https://www.iea.org/policies/2844-bonus-malus-system-for-passenger-cars-light-trucks-and-light-buses,"The Government and Parliament have decided on a bonus malus system for new passenger cars class I and II (motorhomes), light buses and light trucks. When it comes to Class II passenger cars, there is no upper limit on the total weight. The amendment applies from July 1, 2018 and only affects new vehicles registered in the Road Traffic Register as of that date. Only new class I and II passenger cars, light buses and light trucks are affected by bonus malus. When it comes to Class II passenger cars, there is no upper limit on the total weight. The vehicle tax remains unchanged for the cars rolling on the roads today. By new is meant vehicles that become taxable (taken into traffic) for the first time on July 1, 2018 or later. (The vehicle must not have been parked before, either in Sweden or abroad.) For malus, the car also has vehicle year 2018 or later. Bonus - for cars with low emissions: Environmentally adapted vehicles with relatively low carbon dioxide emissions of up to 60 g / km, are rewarded with a bonus of a maximum of SEK 60,000. Malus - increased vehicle tax: Malus means an increased vehicle tax during the first three years for petrol and diesel class I and II passenger cars, light buses and light trucks. The system entails the following changes: 1. The five-year vehicle tax exemption for environmental cars is removed. The vehicles that currently have a five-year tax exemption are not affected. But no new cars will be exempt from tax after the bonus malus has come into force.2. The super-environment car premium is replaced by a bonus for so-called climate bonus cars with low emissions.3. For petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles with vehicle year 2018 or later, an increased vehicle tax - malus - is levied during the first three years from the time the vehicle becomes taxable (taken into traffic) for the first time on July 1, 2018 or later.4. For diesel-powered vehicles that are put into service for the first time on or after July 1, 2018, the fuel factor is replaced with a fuel supplement. The fuel surcharge is calculated by multiplying the total number of grams of carbon dioxide emitted by the vehicle in mileage by 13.52.",Undefined,24 March 2021,https://www.transportstyrelsen.se/bonusmalus,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Taxes, fees and charges|Feebate|Externality taxation|GHG taxation",Transport|Road transport,Road vehicles|Drive train or engine|Battery electric|Plug-in hybrid|Transport technologies,Undefined,Sweden,2018,Ended,National,SWE

Draft Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy 2018,https://www.iea.org/policies/2867-draft-delhi-electric-vehicle-policy-2018,"In 2013, Government of India launched a National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020. Under the mission plan, the Scheme for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid&) Electric Vehicles in India (‘FAME India’) was launched in March, 2015 for two years as Phase-I, which has subsequently been extended up to 31 March, 2019. Several states have also announced an EV policy (e.g., Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh) to complement national policy and address state specific needs.Despite Central and State government incentives, pure electric vehicle penetration currently (i.e., in 2017) remains quite low in India, about 0.1% for cars, ~0.2% for 2 wheelers and practically nil for commercial vehicles. This is largely driven by following critical hurdles: a) high upfront purchase price of EVs, b) almost non-existent public charging infrastructure, c) lack of products comparable to ICE vehicles (especially in the 2 wheeler category) and d) low levels of investment in EV manufacturing capacity.The Draft Delhi EV Policy 2018, to be notified by the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (‘GNCTD’) and which will remain valid for five years from the date of notification, recognises that a new approach is required to kick-start EV adoption in Delhi. It will therefore seek to put in place measures that address the key hurdles to EV adoption. The GNCTD will also develop a communication plan focused on driving awareness regarding the benefits of adopting electric vehicles and the key elements of this policy.This policy will apply exclusively to Battery Electric Vehicles (as defined in Annexure -1, FAME India). Mild Hybrid, Strong Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles will not be targeted by this policy. ‘FAME India’ in this policy refers to the Scheme for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India as notified on 13th March, 2015 by the Govt. of India and any subsequent amendments thereof.Objectives include:• The primary objective of the Delhi EV Policy 2018 is to bring about a material improvement in Delhi’s air quality by bringing down emissions from transport sector. To do so, this policy will seek to drive rapid adoption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in a manner where they contribute to 25% of all new vehicle registrations by 2023.• This policy will also seek to put in place measures to support the creation of jobs in driving, selling, financing, servicing and charging of EVs.",Undefined,12 May 2021,http://transport.delhi.gov.in/sites/default/files/All-PDF/Electric%20Policy%202018.pdf,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Taxes, fees and charges|Congestion charge|Use and activity charges",Transport|Road transport,Drive train or engine|Battery electric|Hybrid|Plug-in hybrid|Transport technologies,Undefined,India,2018,In force,National,IND

Noteworthy among the actions undertaken are the grants-in-aid for replacement of alternative-energy vehicles within the framework of the 2008–2012 Energy Savings and Efficiency Action Plan, the MOVELE pilot project and the subsequent MOVELE programmes, with the recent addition of the MOVEA plans.   Given the difficulties that still exist with regard to the market penetration of this type of vehicles, it is necessary to continue providing aid for their purchase by regulating the granting of direct subsidies. For this purpose, the aid programme for the purchase of alternative-energy vehicles was approved: the MOVALT Vehicles Plan. The initial funding for this programme was a maximum budget of €20 million, with a limit of €600,000 for electric motorbikes (L3e, L4e, L5e). The aid included will be managed by the IDAE (Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving) and will be allocated to incentivising the purchase of vehicles propelled by autogas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrol-gas bifuel or fuel cell, as well as  pure electric vehicles (BEV), extended-range electric vehicles (EREV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV).",Undefined,5 November 2017,https://www.idae.es/ayudas-y-financiacion/para-movilidad-y-vehiculos/plan-movalt-vehiculos,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Payments and transfers|Grants",Transport|Road transport|Passenger transport (Road)|Freight transport (Road),"Road vehicles|Commercial vehicles|Medium duty vehicles, small trucks and minibuses|Transport technologies",Undefined,Spain,2017,Ended,National,ESP

This substitutes the existing antitrust ceilings introduced by Legislative Decree no. 164/2000 (which expired at the end of 2010), also identifying new measures for increasing competition in the natural gas market. The Decree provides that antitrust ceilings be calculated with reference to the market share of each operator, taking into account the amount of natural gas input into the national network, purchases in spot markets, and sales to importers in Italy made at national network entry points. Consequently, market shares will not be lower than the amount input to the network. Operators in the natural gas market will have to comply with a maximum share of 40% of domestic consumption. A mechanism of gas release at regulated prices is provided in case an operator fails to comply with the mandatory ceilings on the market share. This ceiling can be raised to 55% in case an operator commits itself to building new storage capacity in Italy for a total of 4 bcm within five years. The decree introduces measures for increasing competition in the natural gas market aiming at transferring the ensuing benefits to final customers, increasing storage capacity, supporting the security of supplies and enhancing flexibility in the gas system. To achieve this target, compensation to municipalities interested by the construction of new storage fields has been provided.

Car registration tax linked to CO2 emissions,https://www.iea.org/policies/1406-car-registration-tax-linked-to-co2-emissions,"Until late 2007, the passenger car registration tax was linked to the cylinder capacity of the vehicle. From 1st January 2008, Law 34/2007 on Air Quality and the Protection of Atmosphere establishes a new calculation method for the registration tax of passenger cars in Spain, linked to car CO2 emissions/fuel consumption. For this purpose, the Ministry of the Environment led an inter-ministerial working group with the participation of the Ministries of Industry, Development, Consumption and the IDAE, where the specifications of this new registration tax were studied and defined. A new rating for the vehicle registration tax will vary according to the cars CO2 emissions, with the least polluting vehicle being the least taxed. The new tax rates are as follows: - 0% on the vehicle market price for vehicles with emissions under or up to 120 gCO2/km. - 4.75% for vehicles with emissions over 120 and up to 160 gCO2/km. - 9.75% for vehicles with emissions over or equal to 160 and up to 200 gCO2/km. - 14.75% for vehicles with emissions over or equal to 200 gCO2/km. In December 2008, the new tax scheme was extended to two-wheeled vehicles such as motorcycles. The tax rates are as follows: - 0% on the vehicle market price for those with emissions under 80gCO2/km - 4.75% for vehicles with emissions over or equal to 80 and up to 100 gCO2/km - 9.75% for vehicles with emissions over or equal to 100 and up to 120 gCO2/km - 14.75% for vehicles with emissions over or equal to 120 gCO2/km, or those with over 100 horsepower (74kW).",Undefined,5 November 2017,"Law 34/2007, dated on 15th November 2007, on Air Quality and the Protection of Atmosphere",Energy Efficiency,"Regulation|Payments, finance and taxation|Payments and transfers",Transport|Road transport|Passenger transport (Road),Road vehicles|Transport technologies,Undefined,Spain,2008,In force,National,ESP

The vehicles covered are conventional fuel-efficient cars, cars that run on biofuels and electric cars meeting certain efficiency requirements. After subsidies, a small diesel car with low emissions costs about SEK 100,000, while the largest hybrid models may cost around SEK 250,000. First and foremost, it must be assigned to one of the following environmental classes: - Mk 2005 - Mk 2005 PM (cars run on diesel) - Mk EL - Mk Hybrid For conventional fuel-efficient cars, including hybrids, running on petrol, CO2 emissions may not exceed 120 grams/km during mixed driving. For those that runon diesel, they may not exceed 120 grams/km and particulate matter emissions may not exceed 5 mg/km during mixed driving. For alternative fuel cars, fuel consumption in connection with mixed driving may not exceed 0.92 litres petrol/10 km or 0.97 cubic metres of LPG/10 km (with some exceptions for automatic transmission cars). For electric cars, the consumption of electric energy per 100 km may not exceed 37 kilowatt hours; however, this type of car does not currently exist on the market.

The new ordinance included procurement requirements for light trucks, limiting procurement to those emitting less than 230gCO2/km. The new regulations also stated that at least 50% of emergency vehicles must also be classified as environmentally friendly, compared to 25% in 2008. State authorities must report on vehicles purchased and leased during the calendar year to the National Road Administration, including on how many cars are defined as environmentally friendly according to statute.In 2011, the new Act came into force, replacing/superseding this measure.

Vehicle Excise Duty (VED),https://www.iea.org/policies/1683-vehicle-excise-duty-ved,"All cars in the UK are subject to an annual tax called the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED). Before 2001, Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) was the same flat rate for all cars. In March 2001, the VED was reformed to incentivise fuel-efficient, low-carbon vehicles and to send a clear environmental signal to motorists that driving less fuel efficient vehicles will be more expensive. Under this scheme, cars registered from March 2001 onwards are placed into VED rate bands according to their CO2 emissions. Within each band, alternatively fuelled cars, including hybrid vehicles, benefit from a small discount of GBP5 to GBP10, while diesel cars with lower carbon dioxide emission rates than similar petrol cars pay a small supplement to compensate for the fact that diesel cars may emit higher levels of particulates and other local air pollutants such as NOx. The excise scheme is revenue-neutral. Further amendments to the scheme were made in Budget 2002, with the introduction of a new low carbon VED rate for cars that emit less than 120 g/km of CO2. This increased the VED differential between the least and most polluting cars to up to GBP100 per year. Under Budget 2002 the rate of VED for cars producing less than 120 g/km CO2 was  £60/year for cars using alternative fuel, GBP70/year for cars using petrol and GBP80/year for cars using diesel. In 2006, the bands ranged from A to G, classified as follows in CO2 emissions in g/km: A: 0-100; B: 101-120; C: 121-150; D: 151-165; E: 166-185; F: 186 and over (cars registered before 23 March 2006); G: 226 and over (cars registered before 23 March 2006). That same year the government further reduced the VED for the lowest emission cars to zero. In addition, it increased VED for the most polluting cars (graduated VED band G) to GBP 300 from 2007 and to GBP 400 from 2008. VED for band B cars was reduced to GBP 35 per year, while increasing by GBP 5 for all other bands from C to F in 2008. The government also issued new motorcycle VED rates and reformed the company car tax and fuel scale charges for fuel provided for private use. Additionally, a new system of lorry VED came into effect from 1 December 2001. This system was designed to reduce the total burden that lorry VED imposes on the haulage industry, while at the same time improving the environmental signals that haulers face by encouraging the use of lorries that cause less road damage and pollution. Additionally, heavy goods vehicles fitted with certain emission reduction technologies, e.g. particulate traps, or converted to natural gas, have for some time benefited from lower VED rates under the Reduced Pollution Certificate scheme. In 2006, the government developed proposals for lorry road user charging. Announced in 2008, a major overhaul of the VED system took effect in 2009, with the seven bands being expanded to 13 (see separate entry).",Undefined,5 November 2017,http://www.dvla.gov.uk/newved.htm,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Payments and transfers",Transport|Road transport|Freight transport (Road),"Road vehicles|Commercial vehicles|Medium duty vehicles, small trucks and minibuses|Heavy trucks|Transport technologies",Undefined,United Kingdom,2001,In force,National,GBR
