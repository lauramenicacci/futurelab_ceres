New Zealand,Payments|finance and taxation,Buildings|Residential|Existing buildings and retrofits,Warm up New Zealand: Healthy Homes Extension for Rentals Programme,"In 2016 the Government allocated $18 million over two years for an extension of the Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes programme specifically focused on rental properties. The extension provided new funding to deliver insulation to low-income rental households with high health needs (particularly households occupied by children and/or the elderly as they are at the highest health risk from cold and damp housing).  This phase, WUNZ: Healthy Homes (extension) (WUNZ: HH - extension) ran from 2016 until 30 June 2018. When this phase launched it was available for owners of rental properties only, occupied by low income tenants and/or tenants with high health needs, but the eligibility criteria was broadened by Cabinet in July 2017 to include home owners (with the same low income/high health criteria applying).",2016,NZL,IEA
New Zealand,"Payments, finance and taxation|Payments and transfers|Grants",Buildings,Warmer Kiwi Homes,"In 2018 the Government introduced the Warmer Kiwi Homes programme (a four year programme making $142.5 million in grant funding available for insulation and heating).   The programme provides grants to low-income households for insulation and heating retrofits, and is administered by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA). To be eligible for an insulation grant under this programme a person needs to own the home they live in, that home must have been built before 2008, and they need to have either a Community Services Card or live in an area identified as low income. Low income households are determined using the New Zealand Deprivation Index, a tool commonly used in health planning to define low-income areas. Houses located in deprivation areas rated 8, 9 and 10 are eligible for grants.The first year of the programme focussed on insulation as the highest priority for creating warm, dry homes, with grants for heating available from July 2019. The original aim was to insulate, or install a heater (some houses will receive both) 52,000 houses over the four years of the programme.  In 2020 the programme was supplemented with an additional $56 million in funding which allows 9,000 additional houses to be retrofitted. The grants now cover 90% of the cost of getting insulation or a heater installed. The grant cap for heaters is $3000.",2018,NZL,IEA
