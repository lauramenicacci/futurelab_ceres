Incentive policies to create market opportunities for renewable energy on the local, enterprise, and public promotion levels -CRED will work with various Chinese government ministries, environmental committees and utility companies, as well as a variety of Chinese experts and international organizations, in drafting the new lawPreferential Tax Policies for Renewable EnergyAs of 2003, foreign investment in both biogas and wind energy production also benefits from a reduced income tax rate of 15%, as opposed to 33%. Renewable energy enterprises and bio-energy development projects can also request income tax reduction or exemptions. In addition wind turbines and their main components, as well as photovoltaic modules, benefit from preferential customs duty rates. As of September 2007, the Chinese government was developing a series of preferential tax policies to encourage the development of energy conservation and renewable energy. The new incentives include income tax cuts for the producers and consumers of renewable energy, as well as a reduction of the import tax for ""green"" equipment.Reduced VAT for renewable energyIn 2001 value added tax (VAT) for wind power cut in half, to 8.5% (normal rate 17%). In the same year, a circular determined that VAT collected for using municipal solid waste for power generation would be refunded back to the producer. In 2003, the VAT for biogas production was also reduced to 13%.tax and subsidization policy designed to promote hydropower and new energy industries. For instance, production value-added tax (VAT) will be changed to consumption VAT.Renewable Targetsthe Tenth Five-Year Plan emphasizes the commercialization of PV and wind technologies, diesel and battery systems, bioelectricity, geothermal energy, and fuel forests in rural areas.-Inclusive of small hydropower, wind, and solar energy projects -Wind farms are planned for Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Jilin, Liaoning, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces with a combined capacity of 500 MW.-Electricity production goals: Reach 13 metric tons of coal equivalent (Mtce) of electricity using new and renewable energy (excluding small hydropower and traditional use of biomass), with corresponding CO2 reduction of 10 metric tons (Mt) and SO2 reduction of at least 0.6 Mt. -Remote power: Provide power for 1.3 million families (5-6 million people) in remote areas, and provide employment for 200,000 people. -Solar water heating: Increase annual solar water heating to 11 million square meters (m2), with the cumulative amount of 64 million m2. There will be 5-10 large-scale enterprises with internationally competitive ability. -Solar electricity: Increase production capacity of solar cells to 15 megawatts (MW) each, with a cumulative capacity of 53 MW. -Wind power: Increase installed capacity of grid-connected wind power to 1.2 gigawatts, with manufacturing capacity at 150-200 MW to meet domestic market demand. -Geothermal energy: Increase the production of geothermal energy to 20 million m2. -Bioenergy: Increase gas supplies",2001,CHN,IEA,

It covers all modern forms of renewableThe Renewable Energy Law is a framework policy which lays out the general conditions for renewable energy to become a more important energy source in the Peoples Republic of China. It covers all modern forms of renewable energy, i.e. wind, solar, water, biomass, geothermal and ocean energy, but not to low-efficiency burning of straw, firewood and dejecta. Renewable energy becomes the preferential area for energy development under this law. Furthermore, research and development and the industrial development of renewable energy is listed as the preferential area for hi-tech industrial development in the national programme. According to the renewable energy law, the State Council is responsible for overall implementation and management for the development and utilization of renewable energy at the national level. It sets middle- and long-term targets for the total volume of renewable energy development, and, on the basis of this, will prepare national plans for the implementation of these targets. In drawing up these targets and plans, it will cooperate with the regional and local peoples governments to reflect regional differences in the final plans. Renewable power generation projects will have to obtain an administrative permit to proceed with project development; should there be more than one application for the same project licence, an open tendering process will be held. Project developers that have obtained an administrative permit will be guaranteed a connection to the power and gas grid. All output can be sold at guaranteed prices to the grid company, where prices will be determined by the price authorities of the State Council. Grid operators will be able to recover extra costs associated with this regime through their own selling prices. Producers of gas and heat from renewable sources which conform to urban gas or heat pipeline standards will have guaranteed access to these pipelines. Gas-selling enterprises shall include biological liquid fuel conforming to the national standard into its fuel selling system. Energy authorities of local peoples governments shall prepare renewable energy development plans specifically for rural areas with specific financial support. Standards for renewable energy technologies will be set by the standardization authorities of the State Council. In case of breaches of the law by government entities, or grid, gas pipeline or fuel companies, penalties can be imposed by the relevant superior government authority. The Renewable Energy Law is comprised of 8 chapters and has gone through one amendement subsequently in 2009.These chapters include:I General ProvisionLegitimizes renewable energy as the priority tool for development, utilization, and adaptation (see Article 4)Designates wind, solar, hydro, bio, geothermal, and ocean energy, etc. as renewable (see Article 1)II Resources Investigation and DevelopmentIt sets middle- and long-term targets for the total volume of renewable energy development, and, on the basis of this, will prepare national plans for the implementation of these targets.

It has enabled emission-reduction projects in developing countries to earn CER credits. This mandate established by the NDRC operated in five major cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Chonqing and under two provinces Guangdong and Hubei. The governments of these provinces determine the local emissions caps, set up local trading rules, and issue emissions allowances to enterprises with their jurisdiction.As of 2013 118.1 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent have been traded at a range of US$1.7 to US$5.7 per tonne. The scheme resembles the CDM  and must adopt NDRC methodologies approved by the NDRC.Six GHGs are covered including: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6.Third party validation is required as well as project developers must demonstrate additionality and potential sustainability benefits before the projet is approved and registered.
