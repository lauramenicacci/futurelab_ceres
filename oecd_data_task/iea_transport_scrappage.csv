From June 1 to the end of 2020, subsidies for the purchase of EVs with a price lower than EUR 45,000 , will be up to EUR 7,000 for individuals and EUR 5,000 for companies. A new subsidy of EUR 2,000 was also introduced for the purchase of plug-in hybrids under EUR 50,000. EUR 535 million will be used in total for 2020.  ""Prime à la reconversion"" will be reinforced from June 1 until the end of 2020. Households eligible for the scrapping scheme increased to EUR 18,000 (covering 3/4 of the population). Criteria for eligibility was relaxed to include Crit'air 3 vehicles; increased schemes for households up to EUR 3,000 for a thermal vehicle and EUR 5,000 for an EV or a hybrid rechargeable vehicle. These exceptional measures will only apply to the first 200,000 demands.  EUR 800 million are allocated in total for 2020.  The policy mobilises public demand and accelerates vehicle fleet transformation to EV and hybrid vehicles. The government imposed a target of 50% to reach within the auto industry. All B2 sequence vehicle for public demand shall adhere to electronic models.  The policy will also increase recharging points. ADVENIR will prolong the budget to EUR 100 million (2020-2023) to increase 45,000 points across the territory. Recharging points will be implemented along the main transport routes of the country and in collective buildings, with the goal of having 100,000 points by the end of 2021.  As of 19 January 2021, a complementary bonus of EUR 1 000 will be allocated for the purchase and rental of a clean vehicle.",Undefined,5 April 2022,https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/20200526_DP_Automobile.pdf,Air Quality,"Payments, finance and taxation|Payments and transfers|Grants",Transport|Road transport,Drive train or engine|Internal combustion engine (ICE)|Battery electric|Plug-in hybrid|Transport technologies|Diesel|Hydrogen and other alternative fuels,Undefined,France,2020,Ended,National,FRA

Spain mobility stimulus - Program to promote electric and sustainable mobility (MOVES Plan),https://www.iea.org/policies/11564-spain-mobility-stimulus-program-to-promote-electric-and-sustainable-mobility-moves-plan,"As part of the mobility stimulus, Spain enacted a program to promote electric and sustainable mobility (MOVES Plan). The program will facilitate the continuity of investments in sustainable mobility, electrification of the vehicle fleet, deployment of charging infrastructure, and adapting value chains to cover the demand for electric and sustainable mobility. This plan is oriented in four actions:     1. Acquisition of alternative energy vehicles including electric vehicles and vehicles of heavy goods transport with natural gas2. Deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, with a special incidence in job creation and the use of the industrial value chain. 3. Shared electric bicycle systems, intended for public use municipalities or metropolitan areas, or private uses in the field of companies, industrial estates, etc.  4. Measures for efficient mobility to work centres Every million euros destined to the MOVES plan is expected to involve the generation of between 3.6 and 4.1 million euros from the private sector. This program is endowed with 100 million euros, and its management will be carried out jointly with the Autonomous Communities in accordance with their powers. Update 9 April 2021: Under Spain's resilience and recovery plan submitted to the EU, Spain would allocate a budget of 400 million EUR for MOVES programme and 7000 EUR subsidy for the purchase of electric vehicles. The Programme includes subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles (up to 7000 EUR), electric motorcycles (up to 1300 EUR) and electric vans (up to 9000 EUR). Scrapping old vehicles will be needed to access the full incentive. The plan will contribute to reach the goal of 100 000 charging points and 250 000 electric vehicles by 2023.  As of 7 October 2021, the Spanish government approved the EU RRP budget of 27,633 million EUR, whereby 40% of the resources would be used for the energy sector, of which 445 million EUR will be dedicated to the promotion of electric vehicles. As of 7 April 2022, the government allocated an additional budget of 125 million EUR from the Incentive Program for Efficient and Sustainable Mobility (MOVES III) to promote electric mobility in Catalonia, the Community of Madrid, Castilla y León and the Balearic Islands. These regions are the first to have committed the funds they originally received and have requested an extension.",IEA/IRENA Renewables Policies Database,25 April 2022,https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/serviciosdeprensa/notasprensa/transportes/Documents/2020/15062020_PlanAutomocion2.pdf,Energy Efficiency|Renewable Energy,"Information and education|Payments, finance and taxation|Investment in assets|Awards|Finance|Equity",Transport,Transport technologies,Undefined,Spain,2020,In force,National,ESP

This purchase incentive rises to EUR 3000 if the vehicle emits 120gCO2/km, and to EUR 3500 if it emits less than that. For liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vehicles, a purchase incentive of EUR 1500 increases to EUR 2000 if the vehicle emits less than 120gCO2/km. For lightweight commercial vehicles, a bonus of EUR 2500 is provided for scrapping a vehicle meeting Euro 0, 1 or 2 standards and registered before 31 December 1999, and purchasing a new one.
