This will act on the supply-side (woods management, energy crops, use of waste), focus on better sustainability criteria, and measures to facilitate use of biofuels and innovative bioenergy (for example, better fuel quality standards, injection of biogas into the grid, capacity of road and transport for greater biofuel use).The Strategy also commits to using part of GBP 405 million of funding for key emerging technologies for renewable energy technologies, such as wave and tidal generation, offshore wind, and advanced biofuels. The government estimates that the Strategy will provide cumulative savings of 755 MtCO2 between now and 2030, 535 MtCO2 of which will help the UK meet EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) caps, and 220 MtCO2 will provide additional CO2 reductions. Within the additional savings, 73 MtCO2 will be saved over the third carbon budget period (2018 - 2022) and deliver about a sixth of the abatement needed to meet this third budget.",2009,GBR,IEA,

The UK power system needs to tackle 5 main challenges, namely:- Supply security, as old and polluting generation plants are bound to close (20GW by 2020) and as the system needs to adapt to higher levels of intermittent (wind) and inflexible generation (nuclear).- The need for electricity mix decarbonisation to reach 2020 RE targets -15% of primary energy needs from RE.- The increase in generation capacity to meet rising demand (transport sector electrification needs) in parallel with energy savings and efficiency practices.- Great need for cost-efficient investments to avoid high increases in cost of electricity, considering that carbon price and environmental policies are likely to lead to higher bills in the future.The government has identified several key tools, central to the reform strategy, that would allow for the transition to a decarbonised energy system to happen, namely:- The Feed in tariffs with Contract for Difference, expected to start by 2014, will provide a clear, stable and predictable revenue stream for investors. None of the tariff adjustments are retroactive.- The Carbon Price Floor, expected to be in force by 2013, would guarantee a fair price on carbon and provide a stronger incentive to encourage investment in low carbon generation.- The Emission Performance Standard (EPS) expected to be in force by 2013, equivalent to 450g CO2/kWh at baseload, to limit the amount of carbon new fossil-fuel power plants can emit.Engaging with energy consumers to reduce demand will also become a priority both in the electricity and the heating sectors, where the Green deal will help to reduce cost and carbon emissions in buildings, with smart electricity and gas meters. On the short term, the market design reform shall allow for a smooth transition and investments to continue. Therefore, the existing Renewables Obligation will continue for existing projects supported by the scheme (principle of no retrospective change) and new ones until March 31st 2017. Between 2011 and 2017 new renewable energy generators will have a one-off choice between Renewable obligation support of feed-in tariff.

United Kingdom,Regulation,"Buildings|Power, Heat and Utilities|Existing buildings and retrofits",Energy Company Obligation,"The Energy Companies Obligation (ECO) was introduced in January 2013 to reduce the UK's energy consumption and support people living in fuel poverty. It will run until 2017, supporting the installation of energy efficiency measures in low-income households and areas, and in properties that are harder to treat. The ECO replaces two previous schemes, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) and the Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP). ECO places legal obligations on the larger energy suppliers to deliver energy efficiency measures to domestic energy users. It operates alongside the Green Deal (see separate entry), which is designed to help people make energy efficiency improvements to buildings by allowing them to pay the costs through their energy bills rather than upfront. The Green Deal and the ECO will help reduce carbon emissions from the UK's domestic building stock, which is an essential part of the UK's plan to meet its statutory domestic carbon emission reduction targets by 2050.The ECO is intended to work alongside the Green Deal to provide additional support in the domestic sector, with a particular focus on vulnerable consumer groups and hard-to-treat homes. Under the rules of ECO, energy suppliers are obliged to help improve the energy efficiency of their domestic customers' buildings in three distinct areas:1. Carbon Emissions Reduction ObligationUnder the Carbon Emissions Reduction Obligation, energy companies must concentrate efforts on hard-to-treat homes and measures that cannot be fully funded through the Green Deal. Solid wall insulation and hard-to-treat cavity wall insulation are the primary areas for focus under this target. Other insulation measures and connections to district heating systems are also eligible if they are promoted as part of a package that includes solid wall insulation or hard-to-treat cavity wall insulation.2. Community ObligationUnder the Carbon Saving Community Obligation, energy companies must focus on the provision of insulation measures and connections to domestic district heating systems supplying areas of low income. This target has a sub-target, which states that at least 15% of each supplier's Carbon Saving Community Obligation must be achieved by promoting measures to low income and vulnerable households living in rural areas.3. Home Heating Cost Reduction ObligationUnder the Home Heating Cost Reduction Obligation, energy suppliers are required to provide measures that improve the ability of low income and vulnerable households (the ""Affordable Warmth Group"") to heat their homes. This includes actions that result in heating savings, such as the replacement or repair of a boiler for example.",2013,GBR,IEA,

Prior to signing a Green Deal Plan, an assessor will recommend improvements that are appropriate for a property and indicate whether they can be expected to pay for themselves through reduced energy bills.  Green Deal Providers (the companies offering loans) will discuss with the consumer whether a Green Deal Plan is right for him/her and provide a quote for the recommended improvements. Consumers can get as many quotes as they like, and they do not have to choose all of the recommendations made to them. Once they have chosen a Green Deal Provider, the Provider will write up a Green Deal Plan.   The plan is a contract between the consumer and the Provider, it sets out the work that will be done and the repayments. Installation must be carried out by an authorised installer. The Green Deal Provider will help calculate the repayments, including interest, which the consumer will need to make. While the repayments should be no more than what a typical bill-payer should save, the actual savings will depend on how much energy the consumer uses and the future costs of energy. If the consumer moves, the new bill-payer will benefit from the improvements, and so will take on the repayments.    A requirement on larger energy suppliers ""the Energy Company Obligation (ECO)"" will work alongside the Green Deal to provide additional support for viable packages of energy efficiency measures that are unlikely to be fully financed by the Green Deal. These packages could include insulation of hard-to-treat cavities or solid walls. The ECO will also provide insulation and heating measures to low-income and vulnerable households and insulation measures to low income communities.  An innovative brokerage system has been put in place to extend the availability of ECO funding beyond the energy companies themselves.",2013,GBR,IEA,
