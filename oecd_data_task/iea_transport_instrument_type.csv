Given the difficulties that still exist with regard to the market penetration of this type of vehicles, it is necessary to continue providing aid for their purchase by regulating the granting of direct subsidies. For this purpose, the aid programme for the purchase of alternative-energy vehicles was approved: the MOVALT Vehicles Plan. The initial funding for this programme was a maximum budget of €20 million, with a limit of €600,000 for electric motorbikes (L3e, L4e, L5e).

National Biofuels Policy,https://www.iea.org/policies/2475-national-biofuels-policy,"In December, 2017, a new National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio) was signed into law (Federal Law Nº 13.576).  The Policy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the life cycle energy efficiency of biofuels, and promote the national biofuel industry.  It calls for establishment of national carbon intensity targets, to be allocated among fuel distributors in proportion to their market share. Non-compliance can result in penalties between R$ 100 000  and R$ 50 000 000. The law further creates the framework for establishing decarbonisation credits (Crédito de Descarbonização - CBIO) for tracking and compliance with carbon emissions targets, as well as certificates reflecting the energy efficiency and carbon intensity of biofuels. In practice, RenovaBio is designed to introduce market mechanisms to recognize the capacity of each biofuel to reduce emissions individually per production unit. Basically, there are two main instruments: 1) Establishment of national fuel matrix emission reduction targets, set for a period of 10 years. The goals are important to bring predictability, in terms of volumetric fuel needs (fossil and renewable) in this time horizon, and thus allow private agents to make their planning and investment analysis in a less uncertain environment. National targets will be broken down into individual annual mandatory targets for all fuel distributors, according to their participation in the fossil fuel market; 2) Certification of biofuels production by private inspector firms, giving different grades for each producing unit (higher will be the grade for the producer that produces the largest amount of net energy, with lower CO2e emissions, in the life cycle). The note will accurately reflect each producer agent's individual contribution to mitigating a specific amount of greenhouse gases relative to their fossil substitute (in terms of tons of CO2e). The certification process of biofuel production under RenovaBio will be under the responsibility of the ANP. These two instruments will be linked with the creation of the Biofuel Decarbonization Credit (CBIO). It will be a financial asset, traded on the stock exchange, issued by the biofuel producer, from the commercialization of its production (after issuing the invoice). Fuel distributors will meet the target by demonstrating the required amount of CBIOs on their property. Other agents (individuals and companies) may buy and sell CBIOs on the stock exchange, as a way to bring greater liquidity to this market.",Undefined,14 October 2019,http://www.mme.gov.br/web/guest/secretarias/petroleo-gas-natural-e-combustiveis-renovaveis/programas/renovabio/principal,Energy Efficiency,"Regulation|Renewable / Non-fossil energy obligations|Payments, finance and taxation|Performance-based policies|Obligations on average types of sales / output",Transport,Transport technologies,Undefined,Brazil,2017,In force,National,BRA

The scheme applies to cars, light commercial vehicles, as well as motorcycles and scooters. The incentives are provided in the form of a discount obtained by consumers directly from the dealers, who in turn receive this as a tax credit. A bonus of EUR 1500 is provided when a car older than 9 years meeting Euro 0, 1 or 2 standards is exchanged for a new vehicle meeting Euro 4 or 5 standards and that emits a maximum of 130gCO2/km for diesel cars or 140gCO2/km for others. The exchanged vehicle must have been registered by March 2010. This can be combined with a purchase incentive of EUR 1500 should the new vehicle run on electricity, hydrogen or methane. This purchase incentive rises to EUR 3000 if the vehicle emits 120gCO2/km, and to EUR 3500 if it emits less than that. For liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vehicles, a purchase incentive of EUR 1500 increases to EUR 2000 if the vehicle emits less than 120gCO2/km. For lightweight commercial vehicles, a bonus of EUR 2500 is provided for scrapping a vehicle meeting Euro 0, 1 or 2 standards and registered before 31 December 1999, and purchasing a new one. In addition, EUR 4000 is provided for the purchase of a new ""innovative vehicle"", running on gas, LPG, hydrogen. The latter incentive can be combined with the scrapping bonus. For motorcycles, scooters and other two-wheel vehicles, a EUR 500 bonus is provided when purchasing a new 400cc Euro 3 vehicle when combined with the scrapping of a Euro 0 or 1 category vehicle.

It set out the areas of greatest opportunity for businesses, and a programme to assist them in seizing such opportunities.  High-opportunity sectors are:  - Offshore wind;  - Civil nuclear power;  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS);  - Ultra-low carbon vehicles;  - Low-carbon buildings and construction;  - Low-carbon aerospace;  - Chemicals and industrial biotechnology;  - Low-carbon electronics and ICT (Information and Communication Technologies);  - Business and financial services; and  - Carbon markets.  The Strategy included specific support for certain low-carbon sectors, including low-carbon energy sources. Measures include up to GBP 120 million for the development of an offshore wind industry, GBP 60 million for a package of measures to accelerate wave and tidal energy development and deployment, and capital investment of GBP 15 million for a Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre to facilitate joint development and production of high quality nuclear components by around 30 companies.  Several funding initiatives also targeted electric vehicles, with GBP 230 million for consumer incentives to reduce the price of electric and plug-in hybrid cars from 2011, GBP 30 million for electric vehicle charging infrastructure development, and the establishment of a cross-Whitehall Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV).  In addition GBP 6 million in funding supported the construction of 60 or more low-carbon affordable homes, GBP 12 million allocated for a new open access demonstrator facility for fermentation of up to 10 tonnes for industrial biotechnologies, and a fund of GBP 2.5million over the next two years will support SMEs in using the facility.  The Manufacturing Advisory Service was expanded, with GBP 4 million in funding, to provide specialist advice to manufacturers on competing for low carbon opportunities, including support for suppliers for the civil nuclear industry. General priorities for low-carbon development included greater energy efficiency, smarter low-carbon procurement and the construction or retrofit of low carbon buildings.   A suite of measures to facilitate the commercialisation of low-carbon innovation and research were also outlined in the LCIS. Budget 2009 allocated additional funding of GBP 450 million to support low-carbon industries and advanced green manufacturing, GBP 50 million for the Technology Strategy Board, and GBP 90 million for detailed design and development work for the CCS demonstration competition. The UK Innovation Investment Fund was also been created, with an initial GBP 150 million of government investment. The Fund will address the financing gap occurring just before new technologies reach the marketplace. The government hopes the Fund will reach GBP 1 billion over the next ten years.

The Plan is also geared towards energy demand side management and complements the PNAC, the National Climate Change Programme and PNALE, the National Allocation Plan for Emission Allowances. It covers four specific sectors: Transport, Residential and Services, Industry and State, and three cross cutting action areas: Behaviours, Taxes, Incentives and Financing. Within these areas the plan elaborates 12 action programmes covering several aspects of energy efficiency, aiming to stimulate the use of new technologies, the improvement of organisational processes and the change in behaviour and values leading to more sustainable consumption habits. The Portuguese government estimates that implementation of this plan will allow energy savings of approximately 1792 thousand tonnes of oil equivalents (toe) in 2015, which corresponds to savings of 9.8% for the reference period defined in the EU Energy Services Directive. Collectively, the measures applied to all these sectors will lead to electricity savings of 4,777 GWh in 2015, corresponding to a 7% reduction in national electricity consumption. In terms of energy intensity, the implementation of the present plan will allow Portugal to strengthen its convergence with the current European energy intensity average. Transport Sector targets and measures: -Reduce by 20% the number of light-goods vehicles over 10 years old; -Reduce average CO2 emissions for new cars sold annually by 20% (from 143 g/km in 2005 to 110g/km); -Ensure that 20% of the vehicle stock is equipped with monitoring equipment (on-board computer, GPS, cruise control, automatic verification of tyres); -Establish an innovative platform for traffic management with GPS-optimised routes; -Developing urban mobility plans for district capitals and corporate centres with over 500 workers; -Transfer 5% of individual transport modes to collective ones; -Shift 20% of international goods transported by road to maritime transport modes; -The creation of a fleet of ""green"" taxis, with low greenhouse gas emission levels.

Eco Car Subsidy,https://www.iea.org/policies/544-eco-car-subsidy,"Between 1 April 2007 and 31 December 2009, any private individual who buys a new low-emission car for private use will receive an ""eco car subsidy"" of SEK 10,000. For a car to be able to qualify for the subsidy, it must meet certain requirements. The vehicles covered are conventional fuel-efficient cars, cars that run on biofuels and electric cars meeting certain efficiency requirements. After subsidies, a small diesel car with low emissions costs about SEK 100,000, while the largest hybrid models may cost around SEK 250,000. First and foremost, it must be assigned to one of the following environmental classes: - Mk 2005 - Mk 2005 PM (cars run on diesel) - Mk EL - Mk Hybrid For conventional fuel-efficient cars, including hybrids, running on petrol, CO2 emissions may not exceed 120 grams/km during mixed driving. For those that runon diesel, they may not exceed 120 grams/km and particulate matter emissions may not exceed 5 mg/km during mixed driving. For alternative fuel cars, fuel consumption in connection with mixed driving may not exceed 0.92 litres petrol/10 km or 0.97 cubic metres of LPG/10 km (with some exceptions for automatic transmission cars). For electric cars, the consumption of electric energy per 100 km may not exceed 37 kilowatt hours; however, this type of car does not currently exist on the market. The rebate is paid automatically and directly to the purchaser once they have owned the car for six months.

Ethanol Production Subsidies/Tax Reductions,https://www.iea.org/policies/4679-ethanol-production-subsidiestax-reductions,"Since 2002, bioethanol producers in China have benefitted from subsidies, as well as tax reductions or exemptions of VAT or import duties. These reductions and deductions have totalled approximately CNY 190 million, and the Ministry of Finance has provided CNY 2 billion in subsidies to cover losses.The subsidy in 2006 was CNY 1373 per MT of fuel ethanol produced. Starting in 2002, most fuel ethanol produced was grain-based. However, a moratorium on such ethanol plants was imposed as of December 2006 by the NDRC and Ministry of Finance, lasting for a year and a half.The government's policy was to substitute non-grain ethanol for grain ethanol, and not to compete with food requirements.In early 2008, a consultancy undertaken for the NDRC concluded that development ethanol refining capacity based sweet sorghun, cassava and sweet potato in Hubei, Hebei, Jiangsu, Jaingxi and Chongqing was promising. These provinces are now targeted by the NDRC for construction of sweet potato and cassava fuel ethanol plants.A major food organization in China profits from these subsidies and has grown tremendously.China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO), is one of the main companies that handles manufacturing and production in the Chinese ethanol industry.Timeline:1993: COFCO set up its first ethanol plant in Heilongjiang province with annual capacity of 30 000 tonnes and enlarged to 280 000 tonnes per annum.2007: China's first commercialized non-grain based ethanol project plant merged and reconstructed another ethanol plant in Anhui province with a capacity of 320 000 tonnes per annum. A third plant, in Guangxi province, began trial operations in December 2007 and was designed to produce 200 000 tonnes of ethanol per annum using only cassava as its feedstock. 23 July 2010: COFCO founded National Biofuel Research and Development Center in order to accelerate the cellulosic ethanol industrialisation.End of 2013: COFCO had a total ethanol production capacity of 960 000 tonnes accounting for 47 percent of domestic production.",IEA/IRENA Renewables Policies Database,16 April 2021,www.mof.gov.cn/english/english.htm,Renewable Energy,Strategic plans|Payments and transfers|Tax credits and exemptions,Transport,Transport technologies,Undefined,People's Republic Of China,2002,In force,National,CHN

Value of fringe benefits for company cars,https://www.iea.org/policies/2251-value-of-fringe-benefits-for-company-cars,"A significant share of the new car sales consists of so-called benefit cars. A benefit car is a company car where the employer offers the employee to use it also for private driving. These cars risk becoming heavier and more fuel consuming than the rest of the vehicle fleet. To counteract this development, the rules have been gradually altered since 1997. Initially the changes aimed at making the employee pay for the fuel used for private driving and thereby increase the incentives for more efficient driving and less consuming cars.In December 2001, the government implemented new legislation with lower benefit value for environmentally friendly cars driven on biofuels in order to stimulate the sale of new cars with these properties. More than a decade later, the same reasoning remains valid, although the rules have been changed several times, including the very definition of environmentally-friendly cars.The benefit value for cars that can be driven by ethanol (E85), natural gas or biogas is lowered by 20 % compared to a similar gasoline driven model. The maximum reduction is SEK 8000 annually. The benefit value for hybrids or electric vehicles can be lowered by 40 % in comparison to corresponding conventional vehicle. The maximum reduction is SEK 16 000 annually. Starting from 2011, the benefit value is set at 60 or 80% of the corresponding non-environmentally friendly vehicle.Starting in 2012, full reduction is only allowed for plug-in hybrids and vehicles running on biogas.For cars driven by LPG, the benefit value can be lowered to the same level of corresponding conventional car.The main incentive for the rules is to choose a car driven by alternative fuels, but also to reduce the distance driven. This is to be reached through a fuel benefit which is estimated as the market value multiplied by 1.2 when driving the car in private.",Undefined,5 November 2017,http://www.skatteverket.se/rattsinformation/reglerochstallningstaganden/meddelanden/2012/meddelanden2012/skvm201221.5.2b543913a42158acf800023139.html,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Payments and transfers",Transport,Undefined,Undefined,Sweden,2002,In force,National,SWE

Vehicle Excise Duty (VED),https://www.iea.org/policies/1683-vehicle-excise-duty-ved,"All cars in the UK are subject to an annual tax called the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED). Before 2001, Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) was the same flat rate for all cars. In March 2001, the VED was reformed to incentivise fuel-efficient, low-carbon vehicles and to send a clear environmental signal to motorists that driving less fuel efficient vehicles will be more expensive. Under this scheme, cars registered from March 2001 onwards are placed into VED rate bands according to their CO2 emissions. Within each band, alternatively fuelled cars, including hybrid vehicles, benefit from a small discount of GBP5 to GBP10, while diesel cars with lower carbon dioxide emission rates than similar petrol cars pay a small supplement to compensate for the fact that diesel cars may emit higher levels of particulates and other local air pollutants such as NOx. The excise scheme is revenue-neutral. Further amendments to the scheme were made in Budget 2002, with the introduction of a new low carbon VED rate for cars that emit less than 120 g/km of CO2. This increased the VED differential between the least and most polluting cars to up to GBP100 per year. Under Budget 2002 the rate of VED for cars producing less than 120 g/km CO2 was  £60/year for cars using alternative fuel, GBP70/year for cars using petrol and GBP80/year for cars using diesel. In 2006, the bands ranged from A to G, classified as follows in CO2 emissions in g/km: A: 0-100; B: 101-120; C: 121-150; D: 151-165; E: 166-185; F: 186 and over (cars registered before 23 March 2006); G: 226 and over (cars registered before 23 March 2006). That same year the government further reduced the VED for the lowest emission cars to zero. In addition, it increased VED for the most polluting cars (graduated VED band G) to GBP 300 from 2007 and to GBP 400 from 2008. VED for band B cars was reduced to GBP 35 per year, while increasing by GBP 5 for all other bands from C to F in 2008. The government also issued new motorcycle VED rates and reformed the company car tax and fuel scale charges for fuel provided for private use. Additionally, a new system of lorry VED came into effect from 1 December 2001. This system was designed to reduce the total burden that lorry VED imposes on the haulage industry, while at the same time improving the environmental signals that haulers face by encouraging the use of lorries that cause less road damage and pollution. Additionally, heavy goods vehicles fitted with certain emission reduction technologies, e.g. particulate traps, or converted to natural gas, have for some time benefited from lower VED rates under the Reduced Pollution Certificate scheme. In 2006, the government developed proposals for lorry road user charging. Announced in 2008, a major overhaul of the VED system took effect in 2009, with the seven bands being expanded to 13 (see separate entry).",Undefined,5 November 2017,http://www.dvla.gov.uk/newved.htm,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Payments and transfers",Transport|Road transport|Freight transport (Road),"Road vehicles|Commercial vehicles|Medium duty vehicles, small trucks and minibuses|Heavy trucks|Transport technologies",Undefined,United Kingdom,2001,In force,National,GBR
