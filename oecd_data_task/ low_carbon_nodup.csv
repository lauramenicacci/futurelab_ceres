Brussels-CapitalIn 1998, the Brussels-Capital government approved an ordinance concerning the assessment and improvement of air quality. The ordinance contains the following measures in the field of transport and mobility: each private or public body with more than 200 employees per site has to introduce transport planning; for events assembling over 3 000 participants an action plan to promote the use of public transport and of energy efficient and environmentally friendly means of transport must be instigated; regional public bodies and institutes with a car fleet of over 50 vehicles: within five years after the entry into force of the ordinance 20% of these vehicles have to use environmentally friendly technologies. For public transport companies under the authority of Brussels-Capital and with at least 50 vehicles, 5% of the fleet must be environmentally friendly vehicles within a period of five years. Other actions within Brussels-Capital are initiatives to limit access to the city centres, instruments for and study on transport management.",2006,IEA,NA

DOT provides grants for a variety of transportation programs including planning, capital, and operations expenditures on high-speed and upgraded rails, buses, and fixed guideway systems, clean fuel buses, and for the retrofitting of diesel buses. In addition to direct expenditures, DOT programs finance research, development, and deployment programs for new transit technologies, promote transit products for international trade, and provide financing for transit alternatives in parks and on tribal lands. They also promote best practices in increasing ridership, provide technical assistance for project design, and recognize the best companies with transit policies.Federal Transit and Railway programs include the Clean Fuels Grant Program, the National Research and Technology Program, The Paul S.

65,SWE,Financial support,Transport,Value of fringe benefits for company cars,"A significant share of the new car sales consists of so-called benefit cars. A benefit car is a company car where the employer offers the employee to use it also for private driving. These cars risk becoming heavier and more fuel consuming than the rest of the vehicle fleet. To counteract this development, the rules have been gradually altered since 1997. Initially the changes aimed at making the employee pay for the fuel used for private driving and thereby increase the incentives for more efficient driving and less consuming cars.In December 2001, the government implemented new legislation with lower benefit value for environmentally friendly cars driven on biofuels in order to stimulate the sale of new cars with these properties. More than a decade later, the same reasoning remains valid, although the rules have been changed several times, including the very definition of environmentally-friendly cars.The benefit value for cars that can be driven by ethanol (E85), natural gas or biogas is lowered by 20 % compared to a similar gasoline driven model. The maximum reduction is SEK 8000 annually. The benefit value for hybrids or electric vehicles can be lowered by 40 % in comparison to corresponding conventional vehicle. The maximum reduction is SEK 16 000 annually. Starting from 2011, the benefit value is set at 60 or 80% of the corresponding non-environmentally friendly vehicle.Starting in 2012, full reduction is only allowed for plug-in hybrids and vehicles running on biogas.For cars driven by LPG, the benefit value can be lowered to the same level of corresponding conventional car.The main incentive for the rules is to choose a car driven by alternative fuels, but also to reduce the distance driven. This is to be reached through a fuel benefit which is estimated as the market value multiplied by 1.2 when driving the car in private.",2002,IEA,NA
66,GBR,Financial support,Transport,Vehicle Excise Duty (VED),"All cars in the UK are subject to an annual tax called the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED). Before 2001, Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) was the same flat rate for all cars. In March 2001, the VED was reformed to incentivise fuel-efficient, low-carbon vehicles and to send a clear environmental signal to motorists that driving less fuel efficient vehicles will be more expensive. Under this scheme, cars registered from March 2001 onwards are placed into VED rate bands according to their CO2 emissions. Within each band, alternatively fuelled cars, including hybrid vehicles, benefit from a small discount of GBP5 to GBP10, while diesel cars with lower carbon dioxide emission rates than similar petrol cars pay a small supplement to compensate for the fact that diesel cars may emit higher levels of particulates and other local air pollutants such as NOx. The excise scheme is revenue-neutral. Further amendments to the scheme were made in Budget 2002, with the introduction of a new low carbon VED rate for cars that emit less than 120 g/km of CO2. This increased the VED differential between the least and most polluting cars to up to GBP100 per year. Under Budget 2002 the rate of VED for cars producing less than 120 g/km CO2 was  £60/year for cars using alternative fuel, GBP70/year for cars using petrol and GBP80/year for cars using diesel. In 2006, the bands ranged from A to G, classified as follows in CO2 emissions in g/km: A: 0-100; B: 101-120; C: 121-150; D: 151-165; E: 166-185; F: 186 and over (cars registered before 23 March 2006); G: 226 and over (cars registered before 23 March 2006). That same year the government further reduced the VED for the lowest emission cars to zero. In addition, it increased VED for the most polluting cars (graduated VED band G) to GBP 300 from 2007 and to GBP 400 from 2008. VED for band B cars was reduced to GBP 35 per year, while increasing by GBP 5 for all other bands from C to F in 2008. The government also issued new motorcycle VED rates and reformed the company car tax and fuel scale charges for fuel provided for private use. Additionally, a new system of lorry VED came into effect from 1 December 2001. This system was designed to reduce the total burden that lorry VED imposes on the haulage industry, while at the same time improving the environmental signals that haulers face by encouraging the use of lorries that cause less road damage and pollution. Additionally, heavy goods vehicles fitted with certain emission reduction technologies, e.g. particulate traps, or converted to natural gas, have for some time benefited from lower VED rates under the Reduced Pollution Certificate scheme. In 2006, the government developed proposals for lorry road user charging. Announced in 2008, a major overhaul of the VED system took effect in 2009, with the seven bands being expanded to 13 (see separate entry).",2001,IEA,NA
