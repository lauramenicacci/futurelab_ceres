• Putting a price on carbon and returning every dollar to assist households,
support jobs and tackle climate change: The central element of the Clean Energy
Future Plan is the emissions trading scheme. The scheme operates in two stages.
During the fixed price period the Government directly sets the carbon price (beginning
at $23 a tonne for 2012-13). Then, beginning in 2014, the carbon price will be set by
the market. The carbon price reduces carbon emissions by encouraging individuals
and businesses to move their consumption and investment towards less emissionsintensive products. It covers more than 60 per cent of Australia’s total greenhouse
gas emissions across a range of sectors.
• Promoting innovation and investment in renewable energy: The 20 per cent by
2020 Renewable Energy Target (RET) continues to encourage the deployment of
large scale renewable energy projects such as wind farms, as well as the installation
of small-scale systems, including solar panels and solar water heaters. The RET is
expected to drive $20 billion of investment in large-scale renewable energy by 2020,
with much of this in regional and rural Australia. In addition, a new $10 billion

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) is a statutory authority established by the Clean Energy Finance
Corporation Act 2012, which commenced operations on 1 July 2013. The CEFC’s mission is to increase the flow
of finance into Australia’s clean energy sector. The CEFC uses debt and equity funding to promote investment in
clean energy technologies. The CEFC does this through direct investments which attract private sector finance,
as well as making indirect investments through its strategic co-financing partners. Projects near commercial
deployment can access debt and equity from the CEFC at close to market rates.
As at 30 September 2017, and since 2013, the CEFC has made cumulative investment commitments of $5 billion
to projects with a total value of $14 billion. These projects will reduce emissions from energy and industrial
processes, and include investments in solar energy and energy storage. The CEFC invests commercially to increase
the flow of funds into renewable energy, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies.
Each dollar of CEFC investment commitments in 2016–2017 was matched by more than $2 from the private
sector. The CEFC’s investment portfolio is expected to generate a return above the Government's costs of funds.
In 2016, the Australian Government agreed to create three new funds within the CEFC:
• The Clean Energy Innovation Fund (see below).
• The Sustainable Cities Investment Program: The Program supports the national Smart Cities Agenda by
investing in energy efficiency, renewable energy and low emissions technology projects that improve

in the world, and the Government of Canada has taken
steps to make it even cleaner by introducing a tough
new regulatory performance standard for coal-fired
electricity generation. On September 12, 2012, the
Government of Canada published in final form the
Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired
Generation of Electricity Regulations. The Regulations
apply a stringent emissions intensity limit (performance
standard) to new coal-fired electricity generation units
and to old units that have reached the end of their
useful life. The Regulations will ensure that coal-fired
electricity generation in Canada operates as cleanly as
high efficiency natural gas-fired electricity generation
and that no new high-emitting coal-fired electricity
units will be built in Canada.
Under the Regulations, the performance standard is
set at the emissions intensity level of 420 tonnes
CO2
/gigawatt hours (GWh). The standard will address
emissions of CO2
 from the combustion of coal, coal
derivatives (e.g., syngas) and petroleum coke (petcoke),
and from all fuels burned in conjunction with any of
the preceding fuel, except for biomass. The Regulations
also contain flexibilities to maintain the integrity
of the electricity system while still achieving the
environmental objective of emission reductions. The performance standard provisions of the
Regulations come into force on July 1, 2015. Any new
units commissioned after that date will need to meet
the performance standard. In 2020, the first old units
will be subject to the performance standard, resulting,
in that year, in an estimated emissions reduction of 3 megatonnes (Mt) CO2
 eq. The Regulations, in
addition to other measures and commitments made
by industry and provinces, particularly Ontario’s
mandated cessation of coal-fired electricity generation
by the end of 2014, are projected to reduce emissions
of carbon dioxide from this sector by 41 Mt below
2005 levels by 2020. This constitutes a 33% reduction
in GHG emissions from electricity generation for
the year 2020. Significant further reductions will

191,Canada,CAN,NC6,2012.0,Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations,"Canada’s electricity sector is already one of the cleanest
in the world, and the Government of Canada has taken
steps to make it even cleaner by introducing a tough
new regulatory performance standard for coal-fired
electricity generation. On September 12, 2012, the
Government of Canada published in final form the
Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired
Generation of Electricity Regulations. The Regulations
apply a stringent emissions intensity limit (performance
standard) to new coal-fired electricity generation units
and to old units that have reached the end of their
useful life. The Regulations will ensure that coal-fired
electricity generation in Canada operates as cleanly as
high efficiency natural gas-fired electricity generation
and that no new high-emitting coal-fired electricity
units will be built in Canada.
Under the Regulations, the performance standard is
set at the emissions intensity level of 420 tonnes
CO2
/gigawatt hours (GWh). The standard will address
emissions of CO2
 from the combustion of coal, coal
derivatives (e.g., syngas) and petroleum coke (petcoke),
and from all fuels burned in conjunction with any of
the preceding fuel, except for biomass. The Regulations
also contain flexibilities to maintain the integrity
of the electricity system while still achieving the
environmental objective of emission reductions. The performance standard provisions of the
Regulations come into force on July 1, 2015. Any new
units commissioned after that date will need to meet
the performance standard. In 2020, the first old units
will be subject to the performance standard, resulting,
in that year, in an estimated emissions reduction of 3 megatonnes (Mt) CO2
 eq. The Regulations, in
addition to other measures and commitments made
by industry and provinces, particularly Ontario’s
mandated cessation of coal-fired electricity generation
by the end of 2014, are projected to reduce emissions
of carbon dioxide from this sector by 41 Mt below
2005 levels by 2020. This constitutes a 33% reduction
in GHG emissions from electricity generation for
the year 2020. Significant further reductions will
occur in subsequent years. Over the first 21 years, the
Regulations are expected to result in a cumulative
reduction of about 214 Mt of GHGs, equivalent to
removing some 2.6 million personal vehicles from
the road per year over this period. In addition to

broad set of emission sources with increasing stringency over time. Provinces and territories have the flexibility to implement their own system: either an explicit price-based program or cap-and-trade. Explicit price-based programs must have a minimum price of CAN$10/tCO e in 2018 that increases annually to CAN$50/tCO e in 2022. Provinces and territories with cap-and-trade 2 2

that year. A federal backstop will apply in provinces and territories that request it or that do not have a carbon pricing system in place in 2018 that meets the federal benchmark. The proposed
backstop includes a carbon levy on fossil fuels and an output-based pricing system with emissions trading for industrial facilities emitting over 50 ktCO e per year. The Government of Canada 2

248,Canada,CAN,NC7,2019.0,Federal Carbon Pricing Approach and Backstop System,"As described previously, in October 2016, the federal
government published a benchmark requiring that
carbon pricing applies to a broad set of emission sources
throughout Canada, with increasing stringency over
time. A federal carbon pricing backstop system will be
applied in jurisdictions that request it or that do not
have a carbon pricing system in place in 2018 that meets
the pan-Canadian carbon pricing benchmark. The
federal system would take effect January 1, 2019.
Under this system, provinces and territories will have
the flexibility to implement either an explicit pricebased system (a carbon tax such as the one in British
Columbia, or a hybrid approach composed of a carbon
levy and an output-based pricing system, such as in
Alberta) or a cap and trade system (such as those in
Québec and Ontario).
In addition to the parameters above, the benchmark also
stipulates the following:
• Pricing will be based on GHG emissions and applied
to a common and broad set of emissions sources to
ensure effectiveness and minimize interprovincial
competitiveness impacts.
• Stringency of pricing systems will increase over
time to contribute to the national target and provide
market certainty.
– For jurisdictions with an explicit price-based system,
the carbon price should start at a minimum of $10
per tonne in 2018, and rise by $10 per year to $50
per tonne in 2022.
– Jurisdictions with cap and trade systems need:
(i) a 2030 emissions reduction target equal to or
greater than Canada’s 30 per cent reduction target;
(ii) declining (more stringent) annual caps to at
least 2022 that correspond, at a minimum, to the
projected emissions reductions resulting from the
carbon price that year in price-based systems.
• Revenues from pricing systems are to remain in the
jurisdiction of origin and used according to their
needs including, for example, to address impacts on
vulnerable populations and sectors and to support
climate change and clean growth goals.
• The overall approach to carbon pricing will be
reviewed by early 2022 to confirm the path forward,
including continued increases in stringency.
• Jurisdictions are to provide regular, transparent and
verifiable reports on the outcomes and impacts of
carbon pricing policies.

territories to address their specific challenges.",,,,,UNFCCC National Communications

The Regulations will ensure that coal-fired electricity generation in Canada operates as cleanly as high efficiency natural gas-fired electricity generation and that no new high-emitting coal-fired electricity units will be built in Canada.
Under the Regulations, the performance standard is set at the emissions intensity level of 420 tonnes CO2/gigawatt hours (GWh). The standard will address emissions of CO2 from the combustion of coal, coal derivatives (e.g., syngas) and petroleum coke (petcoke), and from all fuels burned in conjunction with any of the preceding fuel, except for biomass. The Regulations also contain flexibilities to maintain the integrity of the electricity system while still achieving the environmental objective of emission reductions.""

The state targets the installation of 1 to 1.2 GW of solar capacity by 2022, seeks to enhance energy security, create jobs in the solar manufacturing and become a main exporter of renewable power to third party and neighboring states. To reach such targets, the solar policy includes a combination of support tools: First, power producers are exempted from electricity duty on the energy they consume and can apply for incentives under the Industry Scheme. Producers of solar thermal energy are granted access to the water quantity required for generation by local authorities and solar power will be guaranteed grid access under both the Indian Solar Mission and the Rajasthan Solar policy. The solar policy seeks to widespread the installation of solar water heating systems on all industrial buildings where hot water is required, large residential buildings, government and private hospitals, hotels and swimming pools. Solar steam systems in residential institutions and hospitals will also be supported. Second, the solar policy creates the RE infrastructure Development Fund to finance transmission network extension, road construction and ease the integration of RE generation. Such Fund will be financed by the collection of a development charge of INR. 10 Lacs per MW installed transfered to the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. The policy also provides for the regulation framework to develop solar parks larger than 1, 000 MW capacity. Such Parks will include Solar Power Plants, Manufacturing Zones, R & D and Training Centres. Third, the Solar Policy creates the Solar Research Center of excellence. The solar policy will fulfill Rajasthan s engagements in the National Solar Mission -install 66 MW of solar capacity- and install additional capacity following a competitive bidding process. Central government will tender 50 MW of solar PV and 50 MW of solar thermal and best bidders will be guaranteed a fixed price by Discoms of Rajasthan. Moreover, the policy will promote the installation of solar PV and solar thermal plans for direct sale to Discoms of Rajasthan with a maximum capacity of 200 MW by 2013 and an additional 400 MW by 2017. Eligible projects will also be selected through auctions. The state will promote off grid and decentralised solar applications and hybrid systems in replacement of diesel based generators. The solar policy also facilitates the installation of solar power producers targeting solar power trade with third party or other states. In fact, Rajasthan aims to become a major issuer of solar Renewable Energy Certificates within the Indian Renewable Portfolio Obligation.",https://energy.rajasthan.gov.in/content/dam/raj/energy/dept_of_energy/pdf/misc/solar_policy.pdf,,2011.0,,Climate Policy Database

On top of the selling price, net electricity produced by thermodynamic solar plants commissioned after 18 July 2008 can obtain a feed-in premium for 25 years. Up to 2012 the bonus varies from EUR 0.22 to EUR 0.28 / kWh depending on the level of integration of the plants. In case of hybrid plants, the feed-in tariff decreases depending on the ratio between the amount of energy not produced by a solar energy source and the amount produced by a solar energy source. The maximum cumulative power of all solar thermodynamic plants eligible for the incentives corresponds to 1.5 million m2 of cumulative surface. The national objective of total power to be installed by 2016 corresponds to 2 million m2 of cumulative surface.

2557,Denmark,DNK,,,Energy Strategy 2050,"The main goal of the Danish 2050 Energy Strategy is to achieve 100% independence from fossil fuel in the national energy mix by 2050.
In a first step to completely phase out fossil fuels the government targets the drop in the consumption of oil, gas and coal by 33% between 2009 and 2020.
The share of thermal production in total energy generation should also decrease from 71% to 40% over the same period.
To reach 100% of electricity from renewable, the Danish government greatly focuses on wind energy, expected to provide for 40% of total electricity needs, together with biomass and biogas. A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector.
Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector.
In the building sector, the Danish government is going a step forward in implementing very ambitious building code, banning oil boilers in all new constructions and, by 2017, in all houses while biomass, biogas and solar thermal appliances will be strongly encouraged.
Denmark also targets the large scale deployment of offshore wind as well as dramatic growth in the wind manufacturing sector, and will fund research and development in for solar and wave power, support main demonstration projects for large heat pumps intended to be used in district heating plants and fund other geothermal energy research projects.
In order to generate revenues to finance the energy shift of the country, Denmark will introduce a public service obligation tax on electricity and gas, while tax on oil, gas and coal will be further increased to discourage their use.

""It is expected that the share of non-fossil based installed capacity (Nuclear + Hydro + Renewable Sources) will increase to 46.8 % by the end of 2021-22 and will further increase to 56.5 % by the end of 2026-27 considering capacity addition of 50,025 MW coal based capacity already under construction and likely to yield benefits during 2017-
22 and no coal based capacity addition during 2022-27."" (http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/committee/nep/nep_dec.pdf)

Program provides two types of incentives: 1) Feasibility study assistance and 2) System installation incentive. In order to be eligible for either of the supports the written approve must be granted first from the Manitoba Hydro.
1) Feasibility study assistance provides up to 50% of the first $5,000 and up to 25 per cent of the remaining cost of the study (to a maximum grant of $10,000 per study). On average, a feasibility study costs approximately $2,400. The amount of the assistance will be limited to 20 per cent of the potential system installation incentive.
2) System installation incentive is based on a prescriptive structure, and is calculated as being the lesser of:
$2.50 per sq. ft. heated by a geothermal heat pump system; OR
$120.00 per MBH of installed geothermal heating capacity; OR
