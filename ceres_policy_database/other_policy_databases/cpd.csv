The operation supports the government’s rooftop solar PV program. By increasing the availability of debt financing and improving the capacity of institutions, it will expand uptake of GRPV in the country. The program addresses the barriers to accelerated GRPV installation. It also allows the consumer to internalize the positive environmental externalities of solar power and thus encourages GRPV installation.

""Based on the policies stipulated in the Strategic Energy Plan, which the Cabinet approved in April 2014, METI established the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Subcommittee under the Strategic Policy Committee of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy in order to consider a future vision of a realistic, yet well-balanced energy supply and demand structure. So far, a total of 11 meetings on these matters have been held.
""METI has approved the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook based on the report compiled by the subcommittee.""
The energy and demand outlook for 2030 serves as de facto energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. For renewable energy, it is described that Japan will aim to increase the share of renewables in total electricity generation to 22-24% by 2030. For energy efficiency, it is described that Japan will aim to reduce its final energy use by about 10%, from 361 million kl crude oil equivalent (coe) in 2010 to 326 million kl coe in 2030.
Original title: ????????????. For the primary energy supply, the envision structure for FY2030 is as follows: renewables 13-14%,Nuclear power: 10-11%, Natural gas: 18%, Coal: 25%, LPG: 3%, Oil 30%. For the power source mix, the structure is for FY2030 is as follows: Renewables: 22-24%, Nuclear power 20-22%, LNG: 27%, Coal: 26%, Oil 3%. Renewables are divided into: Geothermal: 1-1.1%; Biomass: 3.7-4.6%, Wind: 1.7%; Solar: 7%; Hydro: 8.8-9.2%. With a projection of economic growth at 1.7%/year, energy efficiency and conservation measures are also expected to allow a 196.1 bn kWh reduction (reduction of 17%).
Japan's INDC is developed based on this Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook.

The Law introduces several development schemes for the private development of renewable energy projects, including competitive bids, feed-in tariff, and independent power production through third party access.
Competitive bidding to be run by the New and Renewable Energy Authority (“NREA”) open to private sector companies for construction of the renewable power projects. Constructed stations will be operated by NREA. Produced electricity will be sold to Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) at a regulated price determined by Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency (ERA).
Competitive bidding mechanism for build-own-operate (BOO) contracts to be run by EETC and open to private companies for construction, ownership and operation of the renewable power projects. Generated electricity will be sold to EETC on the price agreed between EETC and plant owner.
Feed-in tariff (FIT) support system under which private sector investors are allowed to build, own and operate renewable energy power stations and sell generated electricity to EETC or to licensed distribution companies via power purchase agreements (PPA). PPA determines duration of the contract and a fix electricity price (feed-in tariff). PPA for feed-in tariffs for solar installations will last 20 years, for wind projects 25 years. Egypt aims to deploy 4300 MW of new renewable capacity under FIT scheme between 2015 and 2017. FIT system is open only for solar PV and wind technologies.
Independent power production through third party access scheme allows independent power producers (IPP) to enter bilateral electricity purchase contracts with eligible consumers and sell them produced electricity directly. EETC must allow for conclusion of such contract and make grid network available. In this case, EETC is allowed to charge and collect greed access fee for grid usage.",Renewables,,"In force",2015,,,Unknown,Mitigation,https://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-renewable-energy-law-review-edition-3/1229892/egypt,,,,,,

To reach such targets, the solar policy includes a combination of support tools: First, power producers are exempted from electricity duty on the energy they consume and can apply for incentives under the Industry Scheme. Producers of solar thermal energy are granted access to the water quantity required for generation by local authorities and solar power will be guaranteed grid access under both the Indian Solar Mission and the Rajasthan Solar policy. The solar policy seeks to widespread the installation of solar water heating systems on all industrial buildings where hot water is required, large residential buildings, government and private hospitals, hotels and swimming pools. Solar steam systems in residential institutions and hospitals will also be supported. Second, the solar policy creates the RE infrastructure Development Fund to finance transmission network extension, road construction and ease the integration of RE generation. Such Fund will be financed by the collection of a development charge of INR. 10 Lacs per MW installed transfered to the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. The policy also provides for the regulation framework to develop solar parks larger than 1, 000 MW capacity. Such Parks will include Solar Power Plants, Manufacturing Zones, R & D and Training Centres. Third, the Solar Policy creates the Solar Research Center of excellence. The solar policy will fulfill Rajasthan s engagements in the National Solar Mission -install 66 MW of solar capacity- and install additional capacity following a competitive bidding process. Central government will tender 50 MW of solar PV and 50 MW of solar thermal and best bidders will be guaranteed a fixed price by Discoms of Rajasthan. Moreover, the policy will promote the installation of solar PV and solar thermal plans for direct sale to Discoms of Rajasthan with a maximum capacity of 200 MW by 2013 and an additional 400 MW by 2017. Eligible projects will also be selected through auctions. The state will promote off grid and decentralised solar applications and hybrid systems in replacement of diesel based generators.

• Law on Hydrocarbons (seeks to attract foreign investment to Mexico’s hydrocarbon sector, but also eliminates gasoline subsidies and promotes substitution of oil energy sources by natural gas by establishing lower tax rates for shale gas exploitation; in addition it provides for creation of ‘safeguarded areas’ where hydrocarbon extraction is prohibited)
• Law on the Electricity industry (increase share of renewable electricity, clean energy certification, planning for a smart grid)
• Law on Coordinated Regulatory Organs for the energy matters
• Law on Petróleos Mexicanos (reforms the structure and obligations of the state oil company PEMEX)
• Law on the Federal Electricity Commission
• Law on the Agency for National Industry Security and Environment Protection in the Hydrocarbon Sector (industry operations security and control of hazardous emissions)
• Law on Geothermal Energy (regulates the exploration and exploitation of geothermal energy production for electricity generation and other uses)
• Law on Revenues from Hydrocarbons
• Law on the Mexican Petrol Fund for Stability and Development (revenues from petrol extraction in Mexico, of which at least 40% annually are reserved for long-term savings “for the future generations”, while the rest can be used for investment projects not limited to clean technologies – e.g. oil development projects included)"" (Source: http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/energy-reform-package/)

1. Effective global environmental countermeasures in the power industry
Since effective actions consistent with national plans and targets, are needed in the power sector, promote the development of a sector-wide framework in which;
?The goals are consistent with national plans
?Main business operators including non-regional electric utilities are participating
?Responsible body is clearly defined (focusing on retail stage)
2. Treatment of CO2 within environmental assessment
Evaluate from a stand point below where necessary and reasonable
(a) Adoption of BATs (Best Available Technologies)
?The government will identify and publish “Development and commercialization status of cutting-edge power generation technologies” by size and by fuel types, as s reference for business operators’ consideration and will request business operators to adopt BATs
(b) Consistency with national targets and plans
b-1: In relation to mid-term target?If the business operator takes actions under the sector-wide framework or plans to take measures including mitigation in abroad to offset the net increase emission over a natural gas power plant, it is judged as consistent with national targets and plans.
b-2: In relation to 2050 target?The government will accelerate development of the technologies which is targeted to be commercialized by around 2020, conduct survey on potential CO2 storage sites as a prerequisite for CCS, identify requirements for CCS Ready plants, and request business operators to study continuously including technological development in order to put carbon capture facilities towards commercialization.

Plants must be equipped with thermal accumulation systems. On top of the selling price, net electricity produced by thermodynamic solar plants commissioned after 18 July 2008 can obtain a feed-in premium for 25 years. Up to 2012 the bonus varies from EUR 0.22 to EUR 0.28 / kWh depending on the level of integration of the plants. In case of hybrid plants, the feed-in tariff decreases depending on the ratio between the amount of energy not produced by a solar energy source and the amount produced by a solar energy source. The maximum cumulative power of all solar thermodynamic plants eligible for the incentives corresponds to 1.5 million m2 of cumulative surface. The national objective of total power to be installed by 2016 corresponds to 2 million m2 of cumulative surface. For the 2013-2014 period such bonus values will be reduced by 2% a year; from 2014 onward special Ministerial Decree will define further cuts.

The strategy considers coal as the most reliable and competitive source of electricity available for the country. It provides for the opening or extension of several coal powerplants in Safi and Jorf (planned for 2013, 2014 and 2015). It also foresees oil as a key supply in its energy mix and for its economic development, and plans to expand hydrocarbon exploration activities as a consequence.
The strategy also seeks to foster the use of renewable energy, primarily through the development of wind and solar energy. The development of renewables aims to reduce the use of fossil fuels by 2.6 Mtoe/year and to create 25,000 jobs by 2030.
The strategy considers the improvement of energy efficiency as a priority, especially in the buildings and transport sector.

The targets set for 2030 are as follows:
- Double the energy self-sufficiency ratio (18% at present, including nuclear power generation) and the domestically-developed fossil fuel supply ratio* (26% at present), and raise the energy independence ratio to about 70 percent from the present 38 percent.
*The ratio of fossil fuel supply from domestic and overseas interests that a Japanese company has a share in the total supply
- Raise the ratio of energy from zero-emission power sources such as nuclear and renewable energy to 70 percent (by more than 50% in 2020) from the present 34%. For this purpose:
Build more than 14 additional nuclear plants (nine by 2020).
Raise the overall plant capacity utilization rate to 90 percent (85% by 2020) from the 60% in 2008.
Maximize the use of renewable energy.
Cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the residential sector by half.
Maintain and raise energy efficiency in the industrial sector to the highest level in the world.
Maintain or achieve top-level shares of global markets for energy-related products and systems.
According to the plan, the goal is to reduce domestic energy-related CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030 compared to the 1990 level. Its intention was to increase nuclear energy in the mix to raise Japan's level of energy self-sufficiency, on the assumption this would also enhance energy security. (Although Japan imports all the uranium it needs for nuclear power generation, nuclear power was deemed a ""quasi-domestic energy"" because the government considers it possible to recycle nuclear fuel at home, if the nuclear fuel cycle is based on reprocessing used fuel and using it in fast-breeder reactors.)

By the end of the Strategy third implementation phase, the proportion of Eastern energy markets in the Russian energy export of liquid hydrocarbons (oil and oil products) should grow from the current 6 to 22–25%, while natural gas export should grow from 0 to 19–20%. The Strategy sets a 56 percent energy intensity reduction target for 2030 (compared with 2005). It will be accomplished in three stages: the first is a major overhaul of the energy sector; the second emphasizes efficiency gains through new technology within the fuel and energy sectors; and the third stresses economy-wide energy efficiency.

Croatian National Energy Strategy 2009-2020 has three basic objectives: 1) increase security of energy supply, 2) develop competitive energy system and 3) ensure sustainable energy sector development. These objectives are particularly important due to Croatia’s heavy dependence on energy imports which results in country’s vulnerability to energy prices volatilities.
Targets:
- decrease by 20% greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 taking emissions level of 1990 as a baseline;
- increase share of renewable energy by 20% in annual gross energy consumption of the country by 2020;
- cover 10% of energy consumption in all transport sector with energy derived from renewable sources by 2020;
- decrease final energy consumption by 9% by 2016.

In the overarching energy sector, it aims to reduce emissions by 13% (16GgCO2e) of the sector by 2030 compared to 2006 emissions (120.4 GgCO2e).  For that, in the electricity sector Tonga sets a renewable electricity target of 70% (wind, solar and battery storage). In the transport sector the actions rely on vehicle standards, tax, and tariffs. In the building sector related to energy consumption Tonga plans to adopt performance standards for appliances and lighting. Lastly, for the industrial sector and AFOLU there are no emissions targets (Tonga NDC, 2020).","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,"In force",2020,2021,2030,Unknown,"Adaptation, Mitigation",https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Tonga%20Second/Tonga%27s%20Second%20NDC.pd,01/05/2021,,,,,

The NEP includes a target to reduce energy-related GHG emissions to 15%; however, there is little detail on the nature of this target, such as a date by when it should be achieved.
The NEP also calls for a revival of Nigeria’s coal sector, which currently provides a negligible contribution to the country’s energy supply. The policy targets a 30% share of coal in the country’s energy mix, which we assume refers to the power mix. While the government has handed out 36 coal mining licences tied to 10,000 MW of coal capacity, none of the projects have been successful (Daily Trust, 2019). To be compatible with the Paris Agreement, coal power generation across Africa would need to be phased out by 2034 (Parra et al., 2019).","Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Renewables",,Draft,2018,,,,Mitigation,"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/nigeria/policies-action/

The 1994 decree determined the fixed tariff for solar electricity at ESP 10.42/kWh (€ 0.06/kWh). The Royal Decree (2818/1998) increased the tariff for solar electricity to € 0.22 to € 0.39/kWh. In 2000, it was revised and a new price at which a utility or supplier has to purchase renewable electricity from private generators was fixed. It ranges from € 0.03/kWh (for secondary biomass) to € 0.39/kWh (for PV under 5 kW). From 1999, wind electricity producers could receive either a fixed tariff of € 0.06/kWh or the average hourly market price of electricity plus a bonus of € 0.03/kWh. Rates are specified for both capacity and output credits. Output credits are the highest for wind and solar plants: € 0.07/kWh over a five-year period. Capacity credits are the highest for waste incineration plants; output credits for these plants vary depending on the size of the plant and on the relative importance of any co-fired fossil fuel. They also decrease annually. Buy-back rates for these plants are about € 0.06/kWh in the first year. Buy-back rates also depend on continuity of supply to avoid surges in power sold to the grid. The legislation also provides for guaranteed access to the electricity grid, with agreed rates for connection.

For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. In the reference year its emissions were 102.74 KtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) which has been decreasing during the 2000s, reaching 86,93 KtCO2e in 2018. There is no agriculture sector in the country. Monaco has set the goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050. For this, Monaco is setting efforts embedded in a national policy framework.
In the electricity sector, the goal is to reduce consumption of fossil fuels, so Monaco is trying to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise energy, investing in solar thermal and PV and geothermal networks. In buildings, also, the replacement of fossil fuels to biofuels is being incentivised, as well as, increasing environmental performance and energy efficiency of the buildings using sustainable codes and methods of construction and financial mechanisms for renovations. In the transport sector, Monaco focuses on the reduction of traffic and decarbonisation of the transport. A shift to other modals and public transportation is supported though electric public transportation. Lastly, the industry sector is weak in Monaco being mainly related to craft and cross sectoral measures about electricity will also cover this sector.
Market mechanisms under the article 6 is a possible outlined in the NDC to be used in the future to achieve the outlined reductions of GHG emissions (Monaco NDC, 2020).

In a first step to completely phase out fossil fuels the government targets the drop in the consumption of oil, gas and coal by 33% between 2009 and 2020.
The share of thermal production in total energy generation should also decrease from 71% to 40% over the same period.
To reach 100% of electricity from renewable, the Danish government greatly focuses on wind energy, expected to provide for 40% of total electricity needs, together with biomass and biogas. A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector.
Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector.
In the building sector, the Danish government is going a step forward in implementing very ambitious building code, banning oil boilers in all new constructions and, by 2017, in all houses while biomass, biogas and solar thermal appliances will be strongly encouraged.
Denmark also targets the large scale deployment of offshore wind as well as dramatic growth in the wind manufacturing sector, and will fund research and development in for solar and wave power, support main demonstration projects for large heat pumps intended to be used in district heating plants and fund other geothermal energy research projects.
In order to generate revenues to finance the energy shift of the country, Denmark will introduce a public service obligation tax on electricity and gas, while tax on oil, gas and coal will be further increased to discourage their use.

This strategy has established targets in the five thematic sectors to be accomplished within a five-year timeline up to 2025.
The Household Sector has two targets. It aims to increase the number of household appliances subjected to Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) from six to ten. It also aims for the use of improved efficient biomass cookstoves at 50 per cent of all households currently using biomass cookstoves.
There are six targets to be met in the Building Sector. First, there should be 10% share of newly built floor area compliant with energy efficiency requirements in the total building stock from the current baseline of zero. Second, two per cent of the buildings should have adopted American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standards for energy efficiency of buildings, or equivalent. Third, energy loads due to lighting in public buildings will be reduced by 50 per cent. Fourth and fifth, 20 per cent of public buildings and 25 per cent of the affordable houses the government is planning to build should be green, respectively. Lastly, the sector should develop Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for buildings.
This strategy has also set two targets for the Industry and Agriculture Sector. The sector is expected to increase the number of energy audits carried out from the current 1,800 to 4,000.  The sector is also expected to implement the recommended energy conservation measures to save 100 MW of power demand, 250 million litres of heavy fuel oil and 9 million litres of industrial diesel oil.

After that, gradually other industry sectors, such as cement, steel, petroleum refining and chemicals will be added to the program. The ETS targets is not an absolute emissions gap, but a rate based (CO2/Kwh) cap that is set per category per sector. The rate is based on historical trends and technology benchmarks (Stavins, 2017). For example, coal-fired power plants are expected to have different rates, than gas-fired power plants.

This scenario was derived based on the cost-optimal solution for new build options (considering the direct costs of new build power plants), which was then ""balanced"" in accordance with qualitative measures such as local job creation. In addition (new capacity) to all existing and committed power plants, the RBS included a nuclear fleet of 9,6 GW; 6,3 GW of coal; 11,4 GW of renewables (excl hydro); and 11,0 GW of other generation sources.","Renewables, Energy efficiency",,Superseded,2011,2011,2019,High,"Mitigation, Energy access",http://www.energy.gov.za/IRP/2010/IRP_2010.pdf,,"Share of renewables in electricity capacity incl.

In addition to an economy-wide target to continue to achieve a rate of energy intensity improvement of 1.3 percent per annum the Conservation Strategy sets out objectives for six sectors:
Transport: a more energy-efficient transport system, with a greater diversity of fuels and alternative energy technologies
Business: enhanced business growth and competitiveness resulting from energy intensity improvements
Housing: warm, dry and energy-efficient homes with improved air quality to avoid ill-health and lost productivity
Products: greater business and consumer uptake of energy-efficient products
Electricity system: an efficient, renewable electricity system supporting New Zealand’s global competitiveness

Main objective of the Algerian Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Development Plan is to expand usage of renewable energies and to diversify energy sources in the country.
Goals:
To install 22 000 MW of power generating capacity from renewable sources between 2011 and 2030 (of which 12 000 for internal usage and 10 000 MW for export);
To meet 20% of electricity generation from renewables by 2030
Renewable energy development will drive sustainable economic development of the country, increase energy security supply in Algeria and will have job-creation factor;
Solar energy (both solar PV and solar thermal) is recognized by the Algerian government as a primary renewable technology to be developed. The potential for wind, biomass, geothermal and hydropower energies is comparatively very small.
Combined, Algeria hopes to have more than 22 GW of renewable energy capacity installed by 2030, and has targeted the connection of 4.5 GW by 2020. Should Algeria hit its target, renewable energy would by 2030 account for 27% of the nation’s power outpout, offsetting the need for 22 GW of natural gas generation.

The new renewable energy law establishes more ambitious national renewable energy targets that should reach 20% of total national energy consumption and 40% of total electricity consumption by 2020. Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources. The new legislation foresees the creation of a Special Renewable Energy Investment Service that will act as an interface between public institutions and investors, annually assess the main challenges to renewable energy deployment and manage the support funding allocation process. Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills. In fact, the law establishes that a share of the RE concession taxes paid by RE producers to regional and local authorities will will be allocated to local households as a credit on their electricity bill as a way to share the benefits of living nearby a renewable energy generation plant. The renewable energy generation licensing process has also been very much fasten and eased by the regulation that entitles the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) with the assessment and issuance of licences, under the authority of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. The whole licensing process can not last over a 30-month period. Moreover, absolute priority is given to RES projects combined with desalination plants, when and only when the RES project is on an island and its capacity does not exceed 25% of the capacity of the desalination plant. The law also tackles the grid infrastructure challenge and implements a timely limited target for the grid utility to connect non-interconnected islands to the main grid. Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated. The grid utility is compelled to provide grid access within four months after the connection demand has been released. The Law 3851 also establishes a whole new set of feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable sources, to be found in the Greek FIT article.

The main measures are: 1) As of January 1st 2011, electricity generators from both special and ordinary regimes will be required to pay a fee of a value equal to EUR 0.50/MWh for electricity fed into the grid. 2) As already witnessed for wind and thermal power installations, the number of equivalent hours of solar photovolatic generated electricity eligible for government support is limited. Once that limit is reached, the excess electricity generated by that particular installation during that particular year will not be supported and will be sold at the wholesale electricity market price. Between 2011 and 2013, the share of equivalent hours will remain as established in the Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010 and concerned power stations will then enjoy three extra years of Government support, scaling up the support period from 25 to 28 years.

The National Energy Plan aims to install other sources of energy to achieve a diversification of the basket and ensure a reliable energy supply. The inclusion of wind power plants, photovoltaic solar generation, geothermal energy and generation from the biomass in the country's electric mix is ??sought.
The UPME (Unit of Energy Mining Planning - Unidad de Planeación Minero Energética) identified the possible medium and long-term expansion alternatives that would allow the basket to diversify and have evaluated its impact on the system in the Expansion Reference-Generation and Transmission Plan 2014-2028. Several scenarios were presented. One of the scenarios considers the participation of more than 10% in non-conventional renewable energy in installed capacity by 2028, with a generation that ranges from 2.5% to 7.5% of total production in the period of analysis.
In the most feasible scenario, unconventional sources of energy may account for 6% of the electric energy basket, which would correspond to an installed capacity of 1,207 MW in 2028. In addition to the 474 MW of wind power in the pessimistic scenario, it is considered possible to install 143 MW of solar energy, 275 geothermal and 314 MW of biomass cogeneration.

The report, by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), says that total energy demand in Japan will increase from 940 TWh in 2013 to 980.8 TWh in 2030.","Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Energy efficiency, Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch",,Superseded,2014,2014,,High,"Mitigation, Energy security","http://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/en/category/others/basic_plan/pdf/4th_strategic_energy_plan.pdf

The NEP projects electricity demand and supply planning until the fiscal year 2026/27. It has a cumulative target of 175 GW renewable energy capacity by 2022. The NEP foresees coal-fired power capacity additions of 46 GW between 2022 and 2027.
""It is expected that the share of non-fossil based installed capacity (Nuclear + Hydro + Renewable Sources) will increase to 46.8 % by the end of 2021-22 and will further increase to 56.5 % by the end of 2026-27 considering capacity addition of 50,025 MW coal based capacity already under construction and likely to yield benefits during 2017-
22 and no coal based capacity addition during 2022-27."" (http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/committee/nep/nep_dec.pdf)
It implies that no new coal-fired power plants are necessary beyond those already under construction (Carbon Brief, 2017), and further calls of 57% of electric capacity to be non-fossil by 2027 (Carbon Brief, 2017).
Other targets: Renewable energy generation share of 20% by 2022; Renewable energy generation share of 24% by 2027.
Renewable energy sector is now poised for a quantum jump as India has reset its renewable energy capacity addition target so as to have an installed capacity of 175 GW (100GW solar, 60GW wind, 10GW biomass and 5GW small-hydro) by 2022, in view of the significant renewable energy potential in the country and commitment made by the investors/stakeholders.

(https://carbon-pulse.com/44724/) Mexico will launch a pilot national emissions trading scheme in Aug. 2018 with a three-year pilot phase. The pilot is scheduled to last 36 months, between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2022. ""The pilot will cover the energy and industry sectors. Energy encompasses both electricity generation and fossil-fuel extraction and production. Industry includes, among others, the automotive, cement, chemicals, glass, steel, metallurgical, mining, and petrochemicals subsectors, as well as the pulp and paper subsector. Only direct CO2 emissions will be regulated through the pilot, and participation is limited to entities with annual emissions greater than 100,000tCO2. The system is expected to cover around 300 entities in this phase, corresponding to approximately 45% of national emissions."" (ICAP 2019)
New Developments: In 2017, Mexico began a simulation of a voluntary Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the General Climate Change Law makes the scheme mandatory as soon as its three-year pilot phase concludes. The pilot phase—originally planned to start in August 2018—started operation in January 2020. The ETS will not replace the existing carbon tax.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,"In force",2018,2020,,High,Mitigation,"https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/505745/Brochure_SCE-ENG.pdf

Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, the UK must meet legally binding carbon ""budgets"", committing the UK to cuts its emissions by 34% by 2020 and 80% by 2050.
The Strategy comprises three primary 2020 targets:
Over 30% of electricity to be generated from renewable energy sources, mostly from wind power, with biomass, hydro, wave and tidal power playing important roles;
12% of heat to be generated from renewable energy sources, from a large range of sources (biomass, biogas, solar, heat pumps);
10% of transport energy to come from renewable energy sources.
The key measures to achieve the targets are:
An expansion and extension of the Renewables Obligation, requiring energy suppliers to sell larger amounts of renewable energy. New measures to increase financial support for offshore wind will also be considered.
Introducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities.
New guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards. Before the schemes take effect, GBP 45 million in grants have been committed.
The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will be amended or replaced, taking into account sustainability issues, to ensure transport fuels contain a rising amount of renewable biofuels.",Renewables,,Ended,2009,,2020,Unknown,Mitigation,https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228866/7686.pdf,,,,,,

Energy import dependency relates to crude oil (almost 90%), to natural gas (66%), and to a lesser extent to solid fuels (42%) as well as nuclear fuel (40%).""
""EU energy security has also to be seen in the context of growing energy demand worldwide, which is expected to increase by 27% by 2030, with important changes to energy supply and trade flows.
Moderating energy demand is one of the most effective tools to reduce the EU's external energy dependency and exposure to price hikes. The current situation adds urgency to the previously agreed EU energy efficiency target of 20% that will result in 371 Mtoe primary energy savings in 2020 compared to projections.""
""Energy demand in the building sector, responsible for about 40% of energy consumption in the EU and a third of natural gas use could be cut by up to three quarters if the renovation of buildings is speeded up.""
""In March 2014, the European Council conclusions called for: ""Speedy implementation of all the measures to meet the target of achieving interconnection of at least 10 % of their installed electricity production capacity for all Member States”. Currently, the average interconnection level stands at about 8%. Taking into account the importance of interconnectors for strengthening security of supply and the need to facilitate cross-border trade, the European Commission proposes to extend the current 10% interconnection target to 15% by 2030 while taking into account the cost aspects and the potential of commercial exchanges in the relevant regions.""
""In 2012, energy from renewable sources was estimated to have contributed 14.1% of EU final energy consumption and should reach the objective of 20% in 2020. Looking beyond 2020, the Commission has proposed to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27% by 2030.""
""Coal and lignite's CO2-emissions mean that they only have a long-term future in the EU if using Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS also offers the potential to further improve gas and oil recovery that would otherwise remain untapped. Therefore, bearing in mind the rather limited uptake of CCS to date, further efforts in research, development and deployment should be made in order to fully benefit from this technology.""
""The Union's energy security is inseparable from the 2030 framework for climate and energy and should be agreed together by the European Council.

• Alberta will phase out all coal-fired electricity generation in the province by 2030.
• Approximately 1/3 of this capacity will be replaced with natural gas, and 2/3 with renewables (up to 30% of Alberta’s total production).
• In the interim, Alberta will impose a carbon tax of $20 a tonne in 2017, $30 a tonne in 2018, and increasing in real terms after that. For the electricity sector, this will apply to coal-fired emissions above what Alberta’s cleanest natural gas-fired plan would emit for the same amount of electricity production.
In November, 2016, the Government of Alberta announced the first competition for new renewable energy development will begin in early 2017 with the successful bidders awarded at the end of 2017. It will be for up to 400 MW of renewable energy. The Government of Alberta also announced major changes to the electricity system. This includes:
• An electricity price ceiling of 6.8 cents/KWh from June 2017 until June 2021
• Partial re-regulation of the Alberta energy market (details TBA)
• Introduction of a capacity market (paired with the existing generation market), to encourage development of renewable generation. The market will be in place by 2021.
• Plan to introduce Bill 34, the Electric Utilities Amendment Act, would allow the Balancing Pool to borrow money from the province to manage its funding obligations.
