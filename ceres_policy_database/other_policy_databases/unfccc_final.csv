Australia,AUS,NC2,1994,Natural Gas Industry Reform,"Natural gas is Australia’s fastest growing energy source and, as a clean and efficient source of energy,
has an important role to play in helping to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The
Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments agreed in February 1994 to implement reform of
the gas sector to allow free and fair trade in natural gas. The primary focus of reform has been to establish a regulatory framework to facilitate nationally consistent third-party access to transmission and distribution pipelines through the National Third Party Access Code. This recently finalised Code will enable market participants to deal with pipeliners on fair and reasonable terms, while providing pipeline investors with the opportunity to earn a fair and
reasonable return on capital, commensurate with the risks involved. A legislative package to give effect
to the Code has been finalised. Through CoAG, all Governments have agreed to implement the Code
progressively during the first half of 1998.
Implementation of the Code will promote competition in the delivery of gas, leading to lower prices
and greater choice for consumers and reduced input costs for key exporting industries. In
conjunction with electricity reform, the Code is driving integration in the provision of gas and
electricity, encouraging optimal energy choice and the increased use of cogeneration .",Reduce GHG emissions in industry,yes,CO2,44-45,text,,

Australia,AUS,NC2,1997,Electricity Industry Reform,"Electricity industry reform in Australia was initiated by CoAG as part of broader economic reforms.
Major restructuring of the industry has been taking place following agreement to establish a fully competitive integrated national electricity market across the generation, retail and distribution sectors
by 2001.
The first stage of a competitive electricity market in southern and eastern Australia was introduced in
Victoria, NSW and the ACT in 1997. South Australian generators will join the national market when
the market systems are fully operational in 1998, while Queensland and Tasmania will join following
grid interconnection.
The new market arrangements separate the industry’s sectors to allow for competition in generation,
in purchasing from the central dispatch ‘pool’ and in the provision of services at the retail level. A
system of light-handed national competition regulation of the remaining monopoly (network)
elements will encourage increased efficiencies through time, and appropriate investment in networks
and in upstream and downstream markets.
The reforms also encourage the removal of existing capital subsidies and cross-subsidies, so as to
promote cost-reflective pricing. This is a key measure for the promotion of efficient competition in
supply by embedded cogeneration and renewable energy sources. It will also promote more sensible
patterns of energy use through greater incentives for investment in energy efficiency. In recognition
of the importance of pricing to efficient, environmentally sound outcomes, a review of the proposed
network pricing arrangements will be undertaken in 1998.",,yes,CO2,43,text,,

Funds are allocated to relevant states and the Northern Territory on the basis of the relevant Diesel Fuel Excise paid in each jurisdiction by public generators in the years 2000-2001 to 2003-2004. At the programme start, eligibility was conditional upon applicants demonstrating that installations would displace diesel power with renewables. In December 2004, the Australian Government announced changes to the RRPGP, including: increasing eligibility for proposals to reduce any fossil fuel usage, not just diesel; expanding eligibility to include solar thermal, energy efficiency and projects on the fringe of the main grid; increasing the maximum rebate level available for some projects; and extending the deadline for expenditure of funds to 2012. Qualifying capital costs include renewable energy generation equipment, enabling/ancillary equipment (inverters, etc.) and essential expenditures such as installation costs. The programme was extended in July 2007, with the federal government designating an additional AUD 123.5 million to the programme over four years. Around AUD 328 million will be available over the life of the RRPGP. Renewable Energy Water Pumping sub-programme: The RRPGP Renewable Energy Water Pumping sub-programme provides rebates for business, government and other incorporated organisations, to support the installation of renewable energy water pumping systems in those areas of Australia not close to a main-grid. The sub-programme aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing reliance on diesel fuel for remote water pumping applications. This sub-programme provides rebates for the renewable energy components of water pumps that displace diesel engine powered pumps in off-grid applications. Residential and Medium-scale (RM) sub-programme: The RRPGP Residential and Medium-scale (RM) sub-programme commenced on 23 July 2007.

These programmes have been streamlined in order to engage a larger number of Australian households and communities in greenhouse action over the long term, and on a more cost-effective basis. Funding of $13.6 million over four years to 2007–08 has been committed to this measure to encourage and facilitate greenhouse gas abatement by local governments and the community through: maintaining and increasing abatement from the operations of local government through CCP™ Australia, using local government as the key conduit to the community by providing incentives for local government to take action with local households, transport systems and businesses, leveraging the complementary role of local government in planning and infrastructure provision, increasing the information and resources available to encourage community greenhouse gas abatement. Abatement and capacity building will be achieved through targeted grant programmes, partnership projects with various levels of government, the provision of information, the commissioning of research, and the provision of programme support through the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives. The Travel Demand Management Programme complements TravelSmart activities already underway, as reported in Australia’s Third National Communication. Under the initiative, the Australian Government is engaging with state, territory and local governments and communities to support various approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from passenger transport, particularly in urban centres.

The Australian Government’s $31.6 million Greenhouse Challenge Plus Programme was announced in 2004. It builds upon the success of the Greenhouse Challenge Programme (reported in Australia’s Third National Communication), to strengthen the partnership between the Australian Government and industry to abate greenhouse gas emissions.
The programme is designed to help companies reduce their emissions, integrate greenhouse issues into business decision making and accelerate the uptake of energy efficiency. The new Greenhouse Challenge Plus Programme recognises businesses’ different levels of response to managing greenhouse gas emissions through a tiered approach to programme membership, incorporating partnerships on a
voluntary, incentive-based and compulsory basis. All existing members of the Greenhouse Challenge programmes became members of Greenhouse Challenge Plus. Greenhouse Challenge Plus has around 800 participants, representing almost 50% of greenhouse gas emissions from industry. In particular, it has excellent coverage of companies in key sectors, including electricity supply, oil and gas, aluminium, cement, mining and manufacturing. Most member companies participate voluntarily, but from July 2006, companies that receive more than $3 million per year of business fuel credits will be required to join the programme. In addition, a new requirement for proponents of major energy resource developments to join Greenhouse Challenge Plus is being developed.
Under Greenhouse Challenge Plus, businesses measure and monitor greenhouse gas emissions and deliver maximum practical greenhouse gas abatement by working towards specific milestones set out under individual agreements.
The Australian Government provides administrative and technical support for the programme.
The programme also allows companies that wish to go further in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions to be
identified as Greenhouse Leaders by agreeing to achieve a greenhouse gas abatement goal and report publicly on the
outcomes.
Greenhouse Challenge Plus also integrates the Generator Efficiency Standards (GES) and the Greenhouse Friendly programmes (as reported in Australia’s Third National Communication) into a single streamlined programme. This integration is being achieved through common verification
and reporting arrangements and through a new online reporting tool.
By May 2004, 17 companies, representing 85% of Australian electricity generation capacity, had signed up to the GES, and some have already started implementing their action plans. The Greenhouse Challenge, GES, and Greenhouse Friendly
components of Greenhouse Challenge Plus together are expected to lead to abatement of an estimated 15.8 Mt CO2 -e

Under the programme, customers can elect to pay a premium to their energy retailers for the supply of electricity generated from renewable sources (solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal). Accredited energy suppliers then agree to buy an amount of energy from renewable sources equivalent to the amount nominated by participating consumers and businesses. The programme has similar objectives to MRET—to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity generation sector and drive investment in renewable energy projects— but whereas MRET is a mandatory  (legislated) requirement, Green Power relies on consumers voluntarily paying a premium. Green Power provided by retailers to meet customer demand cannot be ‘double counted’ to contribute to meeting their MRET obligations. Ongoing compliance of products is checked regularly
via financial and technical status reports provided by the energy supplier. Independent audits are carried out by the New South Wales Department of Energy Utilities

level of each facility) that trigger a certain threshold,
which is generally 25 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide
equivalence. Obligations also apply to businesses
that import, manufacture or supply fossil fuels and
synthetic greenhouse gases, and these obligations may

Corporation Act 2012, which commenced operations on 1 July 2013. The CEFC’s mission is to increase the flow
of finance into Australia’s clean energy sector. The CEFC uses debt and equity funding to promote investment in
clean energy technologies. The CEFC does this through direct investments which attract private sector finance,
as well as making indirect investments through its strategic co-financing partners. Projects near commercial
deployment can access debt and equity from the CEFC at close to market rates.
As at 30 September 2017, and since 2013, the CEFC has made cumulative investment commitments of $5 billion
to projects with a total value of $14 billion. These projects will reduce emissions from energy and industrial
processes, and include investments in solar energy and energy storage. The CEFC invests commercially to increase
the flow of funds into renewable energy, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies.
Each dollar of CEFC investment commitments in 2016–2017 was matched by more than $2 from the private
sector. The CEFC’s investment portfolio is expected to generate a return above the Government's costs of funds.
In 2016, the Australian Government agreed to create three new funds within the CEFC:
• The Clean Energy Innovation Fund (see below).
• The Sustainable Cities Investment Program: The Program supports the national Smart Cities Agenda by
investing in energy efficiency, renewable energy and low emissions technology projects that improve
Australian cities.
• Reef Funding Program: The Program provides up to $1 billion over 10 years for clean energy projects
benefiting the health of the Great Barrier Reef. The Reef Funding Program will contribute to the
implementation of the Reef 2050 Plan, the overarching framework for protecting and managing the Great
Barrier Reef.
The CEFC also works through banks and other financial institutions to offer financial products to encourage
businesses to make sustainable purchasing choices for energy efficient equipment, fuel efficient, electric and
hybrid vehicles, and to implement small scale behind-the-meter renewable energy projects.","To reduce emissions from energy and industrial processes, and include investments in solar energy and energy storage.",unclear,"CO2, GHGs",75,table,,

electricity while meeting Australia’s international commitments to emissions reduction. The Guarantee requires
electricity retailers to contract with or directly invest in energy resources to supply an amount of dispatchable
energy while also meeting a specified emissions level for the electricity they buy. The Government is working
with the Energy Security Board and the states and territories through the COAG Energy Council to implement the
National Energy Guarantee.
How it works
The Guarantee will require energy retailers and some large energy users to ensure that the electricity they
contract for or purchase meets both a reliability and an emissions target.
Ultimately, each individual retailer will determine how they meet the requirements under the Guarantee.
Retailers can do this within their existing portfolio of generators, by investing in new generation assets, or by
contracting directly with generators, storage or demand response services that:
• the system maintains a minimum amount of dispatchable capacity to meet customer and system
reliability needs
• the emissions associated with electricity purchased in the market are aligned with Australia’s emissions
reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement.

the CEFC and ARENA. The Fund draws on ARENA’s experience in the renewable energy sector, and its technical
expertise in assessing these projects. This complements the CEFC’s financial investment expertise.
Final approval is provided by the CEFC Board, which is responsible for all investment commitments made under
the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012.
As at 30 September 2017, $43 million in CEFC finance for total projects worth $121 million has been invested in
seven projects under the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. Investments include:
• $2 million to clean-tech company, Wattwatchers to expand production of its award-winning measurement
technology that helps better manage energy use and costs. Wattwatchers clamp-on internet device,
advanced control analytics and cloud-hosted management interface provide real time data showing where

Australia,AUS,NC7,2017,CSIRO Low Emissions Technology Roadmap,"The Australian Government released a Low Emissions Technology Roadmap in June 2017. The Roadmap was
developed by the CSIRO, and highlights opportunities to grow Australia’s clean technology sector, fast track
emissions reductions and be part of future global supply chains.
The roadmap considered the scope for new technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy
sector (including electricity generation, heat production, direct combustion, transport, electricity and fuel
consumption and fugitive emissions from coal mines, coal seam gas operations and gas pipelines).
It considered the possible mix of energy technologies to make a greater contribution to meeting Australia’s
2030 emissions reduction target (and longer term emissions reduction goals) at least cost. Priority was given to
technologies where Australia can become a major part of a global supply chain.
A report under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
The roadmap explored the potential economic opportunities for Australian industry through deployment of
relevant technologies or by participating in growing low emission fuel and technology supply chains.
The roadmap considered four options or ‘pathways’ to decarbonisation of the energy sector, which in
2016 accounted for 79 per cent of Australia’s emissions.
The report found:
• Australia is endowed with energy-rich resources and is well positioned to benefit from innovation in
low-emission technologies.
• Energy productivity will remain important in reducing energy costs and emission levels throughout
the transition.
• While the technology pathways are comparable in terms of cost, they carry different levels of commercial,
technical, social, and stakeholder risks.

Australia,AUS,NC7,2015,Mission Innovation,"Australia was a founding member of Mission Innovation—a global initiative to increase public investment in clean
energy research and development (R&D) as part of global efforts to accelerate innovation breakthroughs in clean
energy technologies. Along with 21 other member countries plus the European Union, the Australian Government
has pledged to double public expenditure on clean energy R&D from 2015 levels by 2020.
In joining the global Mission Innovation initiative, Australia pledged to double early stage government clean
energy R&D expenditure to at least $216 million by 2020, equivalent to approximately US$170 million. The scope
of Australia’s pledge encompasses the areas of renewable energy, energy storage, fuel cells and smart grids,
energy efficiency, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage.
Mission Innovation government expenditure is expected to encourage substantial private investment in new
technology. For example, through the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, Bill Gates has committed US$1 billion
and garnered support from 27 other billionaires across ten countries to direct capital to clean energy projects in
participating countries.
Australia is taking a keen interest in four of the seven Innovation Challenges established under Mission
Innovation: in smart grids, carbon capture and storage, converting sunlight, and affordable heating and cooling of
buildings. Australia has research expertise in all seven Innovation Challenges, and the Australian Government will
be working to support participation in the challenges across the Australian research community.
ARENA will play a key role in delivering Australia’s Mission Innovation commitment, both by providing funding
for clean energy R&D, and by supporting participation in the Innovation Challenges. The Australian Department
of the Environment and Energy will work with the Australian Research Council and the CSIRO to encourage more
funding proposals from the clean energy R&D community. These agencies will develop strategic work programs

Australia,AUS,NC7,2016,National Energy Productivity Plan (NEPP),"The National Energy Productivity Plan (NEPP) aims to accelerate a 40 per cent improvement in Australia’s energy
productivity by 2030. It consolidates national, state and territory government and industry measures to provide a
national framework and an initial economy-wide work plan.
The NEPP aims to boost competitiveness and growth, help families and businesses manage their energy costs and
reduce emissions. This is being done through a package of 34 measures which support:
• smarter energy choices (by providing more efficient incentives, empowering consumers and promoting
business action)
• better energy services (by driving greater innovation, more competitive and modern markets and updating
consumer protections and standards).
Key achievements of the NEPP include:
• Tighter energy standards for equipment: the Equipment Energy Efficiency (E3) program delivers a single,
integrated program on energy efficiency standards and energy labelling for equipment and appliances.
To accelerate the impact of the E3 program, new proposed standards have been consulted on for air
conditioners, commercial refrigerated display cabinets, industrial fans, swimming pool pumps, lighting,
refrigerators and freezers. These measures will deliver an estimated $7 billion in economic benefits and
reduce emissions by 45 MtCO2
-e (cumulative to 2030).
• Expansion of the Commercial Building Disclosure program: requires most sellers and lessors of large office
spaces to provide energy efficiency information to prospective buyers and tenants. From 1 July 2017 the
mandatory disclosure threshold for buildings size was lowered from 2,000 square metres to 1,000 square
metres. This will lead to an estimated $50 million in new energy savings, and about 3.5 MtCO2
-e reduction,
calculated on a five year program duration, between the years of 2015 and 2019.
• Improved energy efficiency of residential buildings: targeted industry training and tools are being
delivered to improve compliance with the energy performance requirements of the Australian National
Construction Code, and ensure residential buildings are built to need less energy for heating and cooling.
• Robust energy use data: the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is
creating an Energy Use Data Model to understand Australians’ energy consumption and influencing factors
such as a change in climate, exponential growth in use of solar electricity, and increasing energy efficiency.
Further improvements to the NEPP are underway. These include consideration of opportunities to improve energy
productivity in the Australian Government’s operations and the introduction of cost-reflective electricity pricing
and competitive metering. The COAG Energy Council has committed $8 million in its 2016–17 budget to support
collaborative work on a number of measures. NEPP measures include:
• Funding of $160,000 over 2017–18 for Victoria to develop a pilot of the Victorian Residential Efficiency
Scorecard’s assessment tool, which measures the energy efficiency of existing homes. This will allow
jurisdictions across Australia to test the Scorecard’s assessment tool.
• Implementation of the Australian Government’s Smart Cities Plan, including the $100 million a year
Sustainable Cities Investment Fund. The aim is to accelerate the deployment of clean energy, renewable
energy and energy efficiency technology in cities. This will be partially driven through negotiation of initial
City Deals.
• The Townsville City Deal, Australia’s first, was signed on 9 December 2016. The Launceston City Deal was

2012 with a total budget of around € 78 million, of which € 35.8 million were spent for
heating and cooling from renewable energy sources (without electricity production
from RES and manufacturing of bio-fuels). The fund focuses on biomass and biogas
district heating, entrepreneurial biogas development (e.g. in agriculture), biomass
central heating systems, solar panels and energy efficiency measures. The major
share of finance (2012: € 33 million) is dedicated to biomass heating and district
heating systems. Furthermore, in order to achieve high efficient projects, district
heating systems, applying for investment aid have to run through a quality
management system. In financial terms the district heating systems are co-financed
by the regions and often also by the European structural funds.

Large-scale hydro power for electricity generation has delivered a significant contribution to power supply since the first half of the last century.
In order to provide for further growth of renewable sources, quantitative targets for 2020 for the increase of the share of wind power, photovoltaics, small hydro plants and biomass/biogas in electricity generation have been laid down in the Green Electricity Act and shall be achieved by fixed feed-in tariffs. After similar previous regulations the current instrument to achieve this policy target is the Green Electricity Act 2012 (Federal Law Gazette I No. 75/2011 as amended) and the respective Feed-in Tariff Ordinance. Tariff support is provided for plants installed until 2020 for a limited period.

of the KLI.EN is to contribute to meeting Austria’s Kyoto Protocol target through
funding of climate and energy related projects. Funds are provided (2007: € 50
million, 2008: € 150 million) for a number of projects and programmes targeting the
increased use of renewable energies such as projects related to research on
renewable energy, replacement of heating systems, photovoltaic, building renovation
of buildings (tourism and commercial), energy efficiency, etc. Support for companies, research institutions or municipalities as well as for individuals, depending on the respective programme. 

NC7: The Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (KLI.EN), financed by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management and the Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology, has been established in order to support the
reduction of GHGs in Austria in the short, medium and long term. It focuses on research in and development of renewable energy systems, development and testing of new transport
and mobility systems and market penetration of GHG mitigation measures.
The legal basis of the Fund is the Climate and Energy Fund Law (‘Klima- und
Energiefondsgesetz’ Federal Law Gazette I No. 40/2007), its objective is to contribute to meeting Austria’s climate change commitments by funding of climate and energy related projects. The funding should bring about a long-term transformation to a climate-friendly
energy system. Two relevant funding concepts of the recent years are “Model Regions” to
help climate-friendly energy and mobility systems to be successful at the regional level and
“Flagship Projects” to help new technical developments to be actually tested and

or for emergencies). Furthermore, clients who purchase a significant proportion of electricity derived
from RES are eligible to freely choose their supplier of electricity. The federal legislation, while
interpreting the European directives on the liberalisation of the energy markets, also promotes
combined heat and power: producers of “quality” CHP electricity will become eligible clients more
rapidly. This policy was reaffirmed by the Council of Ministers in its decision of April 2000. The
Flemish and Walloon Regions will also provide the immediate eligibility of producers and consumers of
renewable electricity or electricity derived from CHP for access to the liberalised segment of the

Belgium,BEL,NC5,2001,Green certificates and CHP certificates,"The Federal Government has formally recorded the necessity of establishing a system of renewable
energy certificates (“green certificates”), by which the electricity suppliers undertake to derive part of
their electricity from RES. The Federal Government has approved, on 7 December 2001, the project of
Royal Decree concerning the green certificates; this decree sets the minimum proportion of electricity
derived from renewable energy at 6% by 2010. Suppliers that cannot meet this condition will be required
to pay fines.
The Flemish Government has also taken the option of imposing a minimum standard (3% by the end of
2004, 5% in 2010) for the proportion of renewable energy on the electricity suppliers, by means of a
system of green certificates. The supplier fulfils its obligations by depositing a certain volume of green
certificates annually. These have to be deposited with the regulatory body of the Flemish Region. If it
happens that one of these suppliers cannot satisfy its obligations, a fine is imposed. These fines will
supply a fund that will be used for the promotion of renewable energy resources. Finally, the transport
of renewable electricity via the distribution network is exempted of taxes. A similar system of
certificates will be introduced for CHP.
In the Walloon Region, “green” electricity will be also be promoted by the system of green certificates,
plus via a system of support to production. The priority is the use of biomass, including various types
of biodegradable waste. Then small-scale hydro-electricity (<10 MW), active and passive solar heating
applications, and wind energy are coming in. The suppliers will be required, under pain of paying a fine,
to supply a growing proportion of electricity from RES (some 4% in 2004 and 12% in 2010) and, with
certain weighting, from “quality” CHP. In Brussels-Capital Region, as in the two other regions, a system of green certificates will be set up. Two

approaches, while taking into consideration the respective competences of
these bodies.
Eleven strategic areas (or fields of
interest) have been identified for this
purpose:
Six sectoral strategic areas have been
defined:
1. Optimisation of energy production
2. Rational use of energy in buildings
3. Influence on industrial processes
4. Development of sustainable means
of transport
5. Encouragement of the sustainable
management of agricultural and forest ecosystems
6. Boosting of waste management efforts
The plan contains five additional broader-based strategic areas:
7. Stepping up of research on climate
change
8. Raising the awareness of all Belgian
stakeholders about tackling climate
change
9. Increase the direct involvement of
the public authorities in reducing
greenhouse gas emissions
10. Implementation of flexible mechanisms
11. Incorporation of climate issues into
the development aid policy
A set of concrete policies and measures
has been produced for each strategic area.
The National Climate Plan establishes priority strategic area undertakings for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2
equivalent) in relation to a baseline.
The second objective of the National Climate Plan is to set up a coordinated monitoring system in order to monitor,
evaluate and adapt policies and measures.
The National Climate Commission is in
charge of regular assessment of the implementation of the National Climate Plan. It
has two types of instruments at its disposal:
– firstly, greenhouse gas emission projection models enabling a ‘rough’ estimation to be made of the impact of policies and measures;
– and, secondly, a database containing
policy and measure impact indicators
with regular updating by the Permanent Secretariat of the National Climate
Commission.
The third objective of the National
Climate Plan is to initiate the drawing up
of a national climate change adaptation
strategy. All sectors need to be prepared
for the inevitable consequences of a rise in
temperatures. This version of the National Climate Plan raises only a few issues.
Since then the National Adaptation Strategy has been adopted (see chapter 6 of this
document for more details).
Finally, the fourth objective of the National Climate Plan is to prepare a longterm strategy to tackle climate change.
The deadlines for which Belgium has to
prepare are, on the one hand, a 2nd phase
of the Kyoto Protocol and, on the other
hand, the negotiations taking place at the
United Nations with a view to drawing up
an ambitious international agreement by
2015. It is also a matter of defining a path
for transition, encouraged by the European
authorities, towards a low-carbon society
in Europe by 2050, a necessary condition,

avoid excessive global warming.",Climate targets,unclear,CO2,65,text,"climate plan, no implemented policies. policies incomplete. detailed information in NC6 text page 65-66",

The GoC also has two significant tax measures that encourage business investments in electricity generation from emerging renewable sources:
• The accelerated capital cost allowance (CCA), available on Class 43.1 and Class 43.2 assets, allows eligible production equipment to be written-off at a rate faster than its normally expected useful life. Class 43.1 provides an amortization rate of 30% on a declining balance basis while Class 43.2, which was introduced in 2006, provides a CCA rate of 50% for certain efficient and renewable energy production equipment acquired after February 22, 2005, and before 2012.
• The Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE) allows for certain pre-project intangible costs to be 100% deductible in the year they are incurred. To further attract investors these expenditures can also be renounced to shareholders through a flow-through share agreement, provided the agreement is made before the expense is incurred. The third area of focus under the federal approach has consisted of research and development efforts.

steps to make it even cleaner by introducing a tough
new regulatory performance standard for coal-fired
electricity generation. On September 12, 2012, the
Government of Canada published in final form the
Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired
Generation of Electricity Regulations. The Regulations
apply a stringent emissions intensity limit (performance
standard) to new coal-fired electricity generation units
and to old units that have reached the end of their
useful life. The Regulations will ensure that coal-fired
electricity generation in Canada operates as cleanly as
high efficiency natural gas-fired electricity generation
and that no new high-emitting coal-fired electricity
units will be built in Canada.
Under the Regulations, the performance standard is
set at the emissions intensity level of 420 tonnes
CO2
/gigawatt hours (GWh). The standard will address
emissions of CO2
 from the combustion of coal, coal
derivatives (e.g., syngas) and petroleum coke (petcoke),
and from all fuels burned in conjunction with any of
the preceding fuel, except for biomass. The Regulations
also contain flexibilities to maintain the integrity
of the electricity system while still achieving the
environmental objective of emission reductions. The performance standard provisions of the
Regulations come into force on July 1, 2015. Any new
units commissioned after that date will need to meet
the performance standard. In 2020, the first old units
will be subject to the performance standard, resulting,
in that year, in an estimated emissions reduction of 3 megatonnes (Mt) CO2
 eq. The Regulations, in
addition to other measures and commitments made
by industry and provinces, particularly Ontario’s
mandated cessation of coal-fired electricity generation
by the end of 2014, are projected to reduce emissions
of carbon dioxide from this sector by 41 Mt below

in GHG emissions from electricity generation for
the year 2020. Significant further reductions will
occur in subsequent years. Over the first 21 years, the

government published a benchmark requiring that
carbon pricing applies to a broad set of emission sources
throughout Canada, with increasing stringency over
time. A federal carbon pricing backstop system will be
applied in jurisdictions that request it or that do not
have a carbon pricing system in place in 2018 that meets
the pan-Canadian carbon pricing benchmark. The
federal system would take effect January 1, 2019.
Under this system, provinces and territories will have
the flexibility to implement either an explicit pricebased system (a carbon tax such as the one in British
Columbia, or a hybrid approach composed of a carbon
levy and an output-based pricing system, such as in
Alberta) or a cap and trade system (such as those in
Québec and Ontario).
In addition to the parameters above, the benchmark also
stipulates the following:
• Pricing will be based on GHG emissions and applied
to a common and broad set of emissions sources to
ensure effectiveness and minimize interprovincial
competitiveness impacts.
• Stringency of pricing systems will increase over
time to contribute to the national target and provide
market certainty.
– For jurisdictions with an explicit price-based system,
the carbon price should start at a minimum of $10
per tonne in 2018, and rise by $10 per year to $50
per tonne in 2022.
– Jurisdictions with cap and trade systems need:
(i) a 2030 emissions reduction target equal to or
greater than Canada’s 30 per cent reduction target;
(ii) declining (more stringent) annual caps to at
least 2022 that correspond, at a minimum, to the
projected emissions reductions resulting from the
carbon price that year in price-based systems.
• Revenues from pricing systems are to remain in the
jurisdiction of origin and used according to their
needs including, for example, to address impacts on
vulnerable populations and sectors and to support
climate change and clean growth goals.
• The overall approach to carbon pricing will be
reviewed by early 2022 to confirm the path forward,
including continued increases in stringency.
• Jurisdictions are to provide regular, transparent and
verifiable reports on the outcomes and impacts of
carbon pricing policies.
• The Government of Canada will work with Canadian
territories to address their specific challenges. ",,yes,CO2,62,text,not implemented at time of reporting,

was doubled in the reform. In the case of heat generation,

Finland,FIN,NC2,1993,Revised Excise Duty,"The excise duty on liquid fuels is levied on car petrol,
on diesel oil, as well as light fuel oil for commercial,
industrial and heating purposes and heavy fuel oil. An
excise duty on certain energy sources is levied on coal, milled peat, natural gas, electricity and pine oil.
Additives and extenders in fuels are subject to the
excise duty under the same principles as the fuel in
question. Light fuel oil, vaporising oil and paraffin oil
must contain a reactive reagent for revealing
unauthorized use.
The excise duties were revised in 1993–94, in line
with the EU regulation. The duty consists of a basic tax and an additional environmentally based tax. The basic duty is primarily a fiscal tax determined annually in the State budget proposal. The basic duty is, however, differentiated to promote environmental protection.
In the case of motor petrol, there is a lower tax on
unleaded and reformulated grades, and in the case of
diesel oil on the desulphurized grade. The basic duty
is also levied on light and heavy fuel oil, pine oil and
nuclear power. Tax revenues derive primarily from liquid traffic fuels, however.
The additional environmentally based duty was
determined in 1994–96 according to the energy and
carbon content of the fuel or energy source. As a rule,
the tax was imposed on primary energy inputs, thus
encouraging improvements in energy efficiency and
production techniques.
The yardstick when calculating the additional tax for
the years 1994–96 was heavy fuel oil; 75% of the tax
was based on the carbon content and 25% on the
energy content. Therefore, the Finnish CO2 tax system was often referred to as the ”75/25 model” as opposed to the ”50/50 model” proposed within the EU. In 1996, the tax component on carbon content was FIM 38.3 per tonne CO2 and that on energy content FIM 3.5 per MWh. The additional taxes on all fuels are determined according to unit taxes worked out in this way.
For nuclear and hydropower, the additional environment tax was levied only on energy content. The energy duty component for nuclear power was the same as for electricity generated in coal-fired condensing plants, where the efficiency coefficient is about 38%. The duty on hydropower was worked out by applying the standard rate of energy content directly to the amount of electricity generated.
As a general rule, no additional tax is levied on
renewable energy sources. Thus, for example, wind
power and the use of waste and wood-based biomass
are not taxed. Only the energy component of the duty
applied to peat, as a consequence of the VAT reform.
The estimated revenues from the excise duty on
fuels and energy products in 1996 were FIM 13.6
billion, representing 2% of GDP. The basic tax accounted for FIM 11 billion and the additional duty for
FIM 2.6 billion. About 60% of additional duty revenues
came from the carbon dioxide component and 40%
from the energy component.
The problem with the system was that few countries
have introduced corresponding taxes. Even those which have, have tried to safeguard the competitiveness of their industry either through low tax levels or by granting special concessions. This was especially the case with domestic electricity production, which was no longer competitive in the liberalized Nordic electricity market.
The tax on imported electricity probably also went
against the Treaty of Rome.
From the beginning of 1997, the energy tax system
was reformed again. A uniform tax was imposed on all
electricity generated and the taxes on input fuels of

In the former system, a special tax reduction was granted to wood and peat-based biomass; the primary energy component of biomass was thereby tax-exempt at all stages of production and use. A similar reduction also applied to natural gas. The removal of these supports was partly compensated for in the excise duties on energy. The additional duty on natural gas based on energy and carbon content of the fuel was reduced by 50% until 31 December 1997. An additional duty on carbon content was not levied in the case of peat up to the end of 1996.

The Energy Audit Programme is one of the oldest national energy efficiency grant schemes in place in Finland. The full-scale programme was launched in January 1994.
The purpose of energy auditing is to analyse the energy use of the facility being audited, to work out the potential for energy savings and to present a profitability calculation of saving proposals. In addition to working out possible ways to use different forms of renewable energy and the energy saving
potentials, the energy audit reports on the impact of the proposed measures on CO2 emissions.
The Energy Audit Programme is a voluntary programme promoted by a 40 to 50 per cent subsidy by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy. The ministry provides subsidies for conducting energy audits on commercial and public buildings and in the industrial and energy sectors. It also supports municipalities to carry out audits concerning the promotion of renewable energy use within the municipality’s territory (Renewable Energy Municipal Audit). Apart from energy audits subsidised by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, there are energy audits intended for blocks of flats and terraced housing. Subsidies for private sector buildings are granted by municipalities, whereas subsidies for municipal housing stock are granted by the Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland (ARA). The Ministry of the Environment determines the total annual amount of these subsidies. By the end of 2010, the estimated savings in energy achieved by conducting audits in the service, municipal and industry sectors were approximately 1.0 TWh per year. About 90 per cent of the savings originated in the industry sector. The corresponding CO2 reduction was 0.98 million tonnes CO2 per year (based on a marginal emissions rate of 600 kg CO2/MWh for
electricity). The emissions reduction is estimated to be 0.65 million CO2
tonnes per year by the end of 2015 and 0.56 million tonnes per year by the
end of 2020 (an example of an implemented energy saving measure is presented in Box 4.3). While 90 per cent of the energy audits are implemented
in connection with the energy efficiency agreements, overlap in energy savings and emission reductions has been removed in the estimates and the
results are additive.","Efficiency improvements of buildings, Efficiency improvement in services/tertiary sector, Efficiency improvement in industrial end-use sectors",no,CO2,105,table,also in NC6 page 118 and detailed information in text page 110-111,

Total new savings from measures under the energy efficiency agreements
(2008−2016) within the industry, energy, municipal, property and building
sectors were approximately 5.5 TWh per year at the end of 2011 (Figure
4.2). More than one third of the energy saved was electricity. The savings
were equal to 1.4 per cent of Finland’s total energy consumption (386 TWh in 2011). For example, in 2010 in the food and drink industry approximately
one third of the savings arose from measures related to heat recovery, while
roughly one third of the savings were related to the heating of buildings.
Within the plastic industry, one third of savings stemmed from more efficient
process cooling. Within the energy intensive industry, savings in the actual
process equipment and processes accounted for more than half of the savings,
while measures addressing, e.g. steam and condensate, were also significant.
CO2 reductions under the energy efficiency agreements were approximately 4.1 million tonnes CO2 per year at the end of 2010 (based on a marginal emissions rate of 600 kg CO2/MWh for electricity). It is estimated that
by the end of 2015, the emissions reduction will be 5.9 million CO2 tonnes
per year, and 5.2 million tonnes per year by 2020 when taking into account
the termination of current agreements at the end of 2016 (see Table 4.4).
Additional emissions reductions have been achieved as a result of the energy efficiency agreement (2008–2016) for the oil sector. These amounted to
0.34 million tonnes in 2010 and are estimated to reach 0.39 million tonnes

The working group suggests that a market-based guaranteed price be introduced for
wind power in Finland. The guaranteed price
for wind power would be introduced in early
2010 for a period of 12 years. At the initial stage, the guaranteed price for
wind power determined by the authorities would be EUR 83.5/MWh. The
difference between the market price of electricity and the guaranteed price
would be paid to wind power producers as a feed-in tariff. For instance, at a
EUR 50/MWh market price, the premium guaranteed by the feed-in tariff
would be EUR 33.5/MWh. The tariff levels would be somewhat higher in the
initial stage of the scheme order to facilitate the rapid launch of investments.
The feed-in tariff is expected to further the construction of wind power in
line with the Long-term Climate and Energy Strategy, the objective of which

case of high-capacity biomass); lack of suitable areas (e.g. offshore wind power); highly asymmetric cost
information; technological demonstration and industrial development issues. Tendering procedures
improve competitiveness in renewable energy development by placing projects in competition with one
another, and are suitable tools for controlling renewable energy development trajectories in accordance
with the targets set by the PPE (multi-year energy programme). When the capacity targets set by the
PPE have not been attained, the minister in charge of energy has the option of initiating tendering
procedures to develop new production capacities. Winning projects can benefit both from a feed-in tariff

The agreement includes the establishment of energy management systems in order to enable companies to monitor their energetic performance. For this purpose, companies are committed to collect data on energy consumption and corresponding output figures in order to generate “energy efficiency indicators”. Moreover, energy audits shall be introduced to disclose energy efficiency potentials in the production processes. In cooperation with the, at that time, Energy Agency (now Energieagence), the FEDIL agreed to conduct information campaigns to raise its members‟ awareness of the issue of energy efficiency and renewable energy use.
In April 2005, a target for the improvement of energy efficiency in the industrial sector was introduced into the voluntary agreement. The FEDIL and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and External Trade as well as the Ministry of the Environment finally agreed upon the adoption of a minimum improvement of energy efficiency of 15% in the time period between 1990 and 2005. In February 2007, the voluntary agreement was amended again and new efficiency targets were introduced. According to the amended agreement FEDIL members accept an energy improvement target of 16% in the time period between 1990 and 2006 and 17% between 1990 and 2007. End 2008, the agreement was renewed again and comprises now a minimum improvement of energy efficiency of 20% in the time period between 1990 and 2010.

through the use of natural gas, is one of the
measures being implemented. The first supplies
of natural gas to the public were delivered in
the first quarter of 1997.
During the first few years of use of this fuel,
around 40% of consumption will be used for
electricity production, and the first gas fired
powered station is expected to come into
operation in 1998, followed by alteration works
to be carried out on already existing power
stations for mixed burning operations.
The increased demand for electricity projected
for the year 2010 will therefore essentially be
fulfilled by natural gas.
The projections suggest that natural gas will
be used as a replacement fuel for other, more
polluting fuels. This will represent around 10%
in industry and 11% in the domestic/services
sector by the year 2010. The consumption of natural gas in Portugal
in the years 2000 and 2010 is expected to
represent around 8% and 14% of the total
consumption of primary energy, respectively.
The introduction of natural gas has benefited
from the support of the Energy Programme, both
in respect of the building of transport and
distribution infrastructures as in actions designed
to further the penetration of gas on the market,

consumption of natural gas.",,yes,,47,text,,

The legislation in the sector has made a
contribution by applying a special statute to
independent producers under which they enjoy
preferential conditions in selling their electricity

development of energy-efficient products and serv-

were initiated and part-financed in the field of en-
ergy between 1990 and 2005. The procurements are
judged to have increased involvement among both
purchasers and manufacturers, and new contact net-
works have been created. The procurement has pri-
marily covered the area of multi-dwelling buildings
and commercial premises. A new feature for 2009 is that technology procurement is also to be organ-
ised for land-based industries. At least SEK 50 mil-
lion is being invested in technology procurement and
market introduction in 2009. The five-year energy
efficiency programme 2010-2014 includes increased
support for technology procurement and market in-
troduction in the industrial, residential and service
and transport sectors.
A combined estimate by the Energy Efficiency In-
quiry (SOU2008:110) was that the efficiency-im-

gases besides carbon dioxide. The exception is leaching of methane from waste landfills, for
which the goal is a reduction of emissions by 30% by the year 2000. Developing sinks, for
example by means of continued good silvicultural practices, is regarded as a complement to
the limitation of carbon dioxide emissions. Later the Riksdag decided on goals for emissions
of HFCs and FCs and other closely-related gases. Emissons of these gases may not exceed 2%

energy-related CO2 emissions provides the principal legal basis for compliance with Switzerland’s
Kyoto commitments. To limit the use of fossil fuels accounting for about 75% of Switzerland’s
GHG emissions, the CO 2 Act stipulates reduction targets for 2010 compared to 1990 levels. Apart
from an overall reduction target of 10%, emissions from heating/process fuels are to be lowered by
15% and emissions from transport fuels by 8%. In lowering fossil fuel consumption, priority is to
be given to voluntary action. However, if voluntary and other CO 2 -related measures do not suffice,
the Federal Council is authorized to resort to an incentive tax. The tax rates depend on the
shortfalls in meeting the sectoral targets and require the approval of Parliament. Net revenues are to
be fully redistributed to the population on a per-capita basis and to businesses as a percentage of
wages paid. The need for a CO 2 tax is determined by means of energy projection models (see
Section 5.1.1). In assessing how far CO2 reduction targets have been met, all relevant measures in
other policy sectors are to be taken into account. The CO2 Act allows for the use of flexible
mechanisms supplemental to domestic action. The implementation of this provision is regulated in

by 2010. This aim is compatible with the CO2 Law (under the commitments made
at the Kyoto climate conference in December 1997). A continuous reduction in
the growth rate of electricity consumption during the 1990s, and stabilisation
of demand after 2000 were also foreseen. Thirdly, the proportion of renewable
energy was to be increased by 0.5 per cent for electricity generation, and by 3 per
cent for heat generation, by the year 2000. At the same time, the production of
hydropower was to be increased by 5 per cent and the capacity of existing nuclear
plant by 10 per cent. The ‘Energy 2000’ programme induced many activities (not specially described
here), such as energy management (for instance in hospitals), energy audits in companies,
supporting the use of renewable energy, encouraging energy efficiency, information
partnership in the building sector, energy saving services for small and medium enterprises,
optimisation of construction technologies. „Energy 2000“ is based on the following
three principles.
1. Voluntary measures for the efficient use
of energy and for the use of renewable
forms of energy.
2. State framework conditions for a supply
of energy which is sufficient, safe, and

energy) with interest groups and those
affected.

properties, with repayments made through their energy bill. Repayments are made on a Pay-
As-You-Save (PAYS) basis: after the improvement has been made, the consumer begins to save
energy, their energy bills are less than they would have been without the improvement, and
these savings are used to repay the loan.
The National Communication reported some early interest in the Green Deal. At that stage,
there had been over 100,000 Green Deal Assessments in properties (the first step before taking
out a Green Deal loan). The initial interest was in domestic properties, and the Government
had envisaged that the non-domestic Green Deal market would take longer than the domestic
market to develop.
In the event, uptake across both sectors was significantly below expectations. In July 2015,
the Government announced there would be no further public investment in the scheme. The
Framework set up to support the programme, however, remained in place to service existing
Green Deal Plans and for any private finance providers wishing to enter the market.
The Government is now considering options for the future of the Green Deal Framework in the
light of a number of factors. There may be several reasons why the uptake of the Green Deal
was below expectations, and the Government will learn from these. The Government believes,
however, that the PAYS mechanism at the heart of the Green Deal could still play a valuable role,
in both the domestic and non-domestic market. A key factor for optimism that PAYS can play
a role is the interest from a number of finance providers, not least from the new owners of the
Green Deal Finance Company, which was the vehicle originally created to finance Green Deal
loans and in which the Government ended public investment during 2015.
In October 2017, the Government launched a “Call for Evidence on the reform of the Green Deal
Framework”. The outcomes of this call for evidence will help to inform Government decisions on
the future of the Green Deal, including for the non-domestic sector.",,unclear,,106,text,unclear if this is actually implemented,

over half a billion pounds over the next four years and by the end of 2021 Scottish Government
will have allocated over £1 billion since 2009 on tackling fuel poverty and energy efficiency measures. It will be a co-ordinated programme to improve the energy efficiency of homes and
buildings in the commercial, public and industrial sectors. Initial estimates suggest required
overall investment of around £10bn from a range of public and private sources.
The Scottish Government’s existing advice, support and loan services for residential (Home
Energy Scotland) and the business and public sectors (Resource Efficient Scotland) will continue
to deliver during the design phase of SEEP. As SEEP develops over the longer term, the future

United Kingdom,GBR,NC7,,Energy from waste,"The incineration of energy from waste (EfW) is supported under the RHI through the biomass
tariff and so links to the energy supply section. The RHI pays a tariff for the proportion of
heat generated from the biomass in municipal solid waste (MSW), which is typically 50% or
higher. Currently, other types of waste, such as commercial and industrial waste are excluded.
However, other types of waste are supported under the Renewables Obligation (RO).
Energy from waste has the dual benefit of producing renewable energy and avoiding harmful
CH4 emissions when the biodegradable proportion of this waste decays in landfill. The main
input fuels for incineration are currently waste collected by local authorities , commercial and
industrial waste, and in some cases construction and demolition waste.
The Government wishs to align the RO with the RHI and not present additional barriers to
participants already complying with the RO requirements. It will therefore extend support
under the RHI to energy from commercial and industrial wastes where not more than 90% of
the waste is, or is derived, from fossil fuel (i.e. waste has a biomass content of at least 10%).
Participants will receive support only on the biomass proportion of their waste and will therefore
have to demonstrate what proportion of the waste is biomass.",,yes,,147,text,,

‘microgeneration becoming an everyday technology used in homes and businesses’ helping to
reduce carbon emissions. Industry was actively involved in the development of the strategy and
participated in the implementation process. An interim report was published in July 201279 and
the final report published at the end of October.80
The government has continued the development of the Microgeneration Certification Scheme
(MCS) making it more accessible to people working in related professions – such as heating
engineers and plumbers – so that they can qualify to install microgeneration. The MCS
installation standards have been strengthened. New guidance for solar PV installers has been

United Kingdom,GBR,NC6,2012,Energy Efficiency Stategy: the Energy Efficiency Opportunity in the UK,"The government’s Energy Efficiency Strategy: the Energy Efficiency Opportunity in the UK,72

efficiency the UK could be saving 196 TWh in 2020.73 Our existing policy package should save
the UK 154 TWh in 2020.
The Energy Efficiency Strategy identified four key barriers to the deployment of cost-effective
energy efficiency investments in the UK economy:
Embryonic markets: The UK already has an energy efficiency market but it is small relative to
the size of the opportunity. There are significant economic benefits to be realised from growing
this market and making energy efficiency a mainstream activity.
Information: There is currently a lack of access to trusted and appropriate energy efficiency
information. Where information is available it may be generic and not tailored to specific
circumstances, which means that enterprises are not able to fully assess the benefits of an
energy efficiency investment.
Misaligned financial incentives: Those investing in energy efficiency measures are not always
the ones receiving the direct benefit. For example, the wider benefits of energy efficiency
investment, such as improved security of supply and reduced carbon emissions, are not always
realised by those making the investment.
Undervaluing energy efficiency: Partly as a result of the lack of trusted information,
the long-term benefits of improved energy efficiency are often regarded as less certain.
Consequently, energy efficiency is undervalued relative to other investment options and not
prioritised as it might otherwise be.
Over the last twelve months, the UK has made good progress towards overcoming these
barriers. The introduction of new policies and the simplification of existing ones has resulted
in: expanded choice and support for households; simplified and extended support for UK
businesses and the public sector; improved access to financing for energy efficiency measures;
and improved awareness of the benefits of energy efficiency.",, no,,78,text,,

United States of America,USA,NC2,,Update State Building Codes (Action 10),"Energy standards and guidelines for buildings are effective means of improving
energy efficiency because they eliminate inefficient construction practices and
technologies. DOE’s increased emphasis on successful adoption of these practices has
resulted in five hundred training sessions; more than ten thousand copies of “MECcheck”
building code software distributed to more than twenty states; responses to more than 250
requests per month; and nearly four million dollars in financial assistance to twenty-eight
states and territories to update and implement their energy-efficient building codes and
standards.
The program is on target with thirty-four states meeting EPAct requirements for
residential energy codes. In 1996 five new states adopted residential energy codes that
meet or exceed the national model energy code. DOE is working with ten states to help
them become early adopters of portions of the next generation of the building industry’s
commercial building consensus standard. In addition, DOE has developed a simple
computer program and package compliance approach for assessing compliance with low-
rise commercial building standards.",,no,,86,text,,

an ultra-high-efficiency and environmentally benign method of producing electricity and
by-product thermal energy. This technology provides a means of converting a fuel’s
chemical energy into electrical energy without a combustion process.",,yes,,93,text,,
United States of America,USA,NC2,,Renewable Energy Commercialization (Action 26),"DOE strives to commercialize renewable energy by working with U.S. renewable
energy companies, electric utilities, and other end users in cost-shared partnerships that
share development risk and advance toward agreed-upon cost-reduction targets. Potential
buyers of renewables are encouraged to work directly with the renewables industry and
DOE to form market-pull partnership consortia to advance common goals toward
accepted commercialization targets. These groups include the Utility PhotoVoltaic Group,
Solar II (solar thermal central receiver) Commercialization Consortium, Utility Biomass
Energy Commercialization Association, Utility Wind Interest Group, USH20 (Solar Hot

environmentally sound upgrades at existing federal hydroelectric projects and to sell the
incremental power thus generated at market rates. Significant technological potential
exists for increasing generation at hydroelectric facilities, but institutional barriers have
complicated efforts to make these profitable efficiency upgrades. Nonfederal investments
will increase generation from hydroelectric facilities, reducing the need for fossil-fuel-fired
generation. Furthermore, lease payments to the federal government will help reduce the
federal deficit. Implementing legislation is currently being drafted.",,yes,,94,text,,
United States of America,USA,NC2,1992,Energy-Efficient Distribution Transformer Standards (Action 29),"In 1992, EPAct required DOE to determine if standards are warranted for
distribution transformers. In July 1996 the Oak Ridge National Laboratory prepared a
report entitled Determination Analysis of Energy Conservation Standards for Distribution
Transformers, which was peer reviewed by manufacturers of transformers, steel, and
aluminum and by utilities, associations, and energy-conservation public interest groups.
The report revealed that all energy-conservation cases that were analyzed are technically
feasible, appear to be economically justified, and have the potential for significant energy
savings. Based on the energy conservation cases analyzed, the potential savings range
from 3.6 to 13.7 cumulative quads over the period 2000–2030. The study methodology
consisted of four major elements: development of a data base, development of
conservation options, assessments of energy-conservation options, and incorporation of
feedback from stakeholders. DOE plans to publish a determination notice this year of its
decision as to whether efficiency standards are warranted for distribution transformers.",,unclear,,94,text,,
United States of America,USA,NC2,,ENERGY STAR Distribution Transformers (Action 30),"In 1991, about 7.4 percent of U.S. electric generation was lost while being
distributed from power plants to consumers, and approximately 50 billion kilowatt-hours
are lost every year in the delivery of electricity from distribution transformers. Stemming
transmission and distribution losses will decrease the amount of electricity that needs to be
generated to meet electricity demands, thus reducing CO2 emissions.
The United States is implementing an ENERGY STAR® labeling program to
encourage electric utilities to invest in high-efficiency transformers that reduce transformer
losses. Participating utilities agree to purchase only qualifying equipment designated with
the ENERGY STAR® logo and to accelerate the replacement of higher-loss transformers
where economically warranted. EPA is also distributing information regarding energy-
efficient transformers to utilities and state regulatory bodies and is helping participating
utilities organize group purchases of energy-efficient transformers to obtain lower prices.",,yes,,"94, 95",text,unclear if this overlaps with other ENERGYSTAR measures,
