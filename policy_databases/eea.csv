The previous formula didn’t take into account CO2 emissions. The reference CO2 levels are fixed each year by royal decree. The advantage can never be below 820 EUR/year (base amount –1340 in 2020).

This is a difficult exercise as the measure is rather a collection of vague measures of which the impact is hard to measure.
We then see how much emissions were gained by making the difference between the emission per carkm and trainpkm and multiplying this difference by the number of car drivers that switched thanks to the measure.
The formula below expresses this:
ER = Ntpkm * (EFcar-EFtrain)
with
ER: emission reduction
Ntpkm: new train pkm thanks to the policy AND previously done by car
EF: emission factor
The most difficult part in the methodology is to determine the amount of passengerkm that were done by
car previously AND that were attracted thanks to the measures described above (Nptkm).
Therefore, we start by subtracting the number of commuterkm shifted thanks to the TR-A08 from the total trainpkm.
For the next step we work with different scenarios. The assumptions for the scenarios are given under the assumption section.
The 2014 VITO evaluation states that the increase in passengerkm corresponds to a modal shift from cars to railway on a one-to-one pkm basis. VITO provides however no source for this assumption.
To clarify this point, we did a literature research on the possible switch from car to rail when making rail more attractive. We provide the literature research annexed and the conclusions in the next section.
Based on the information we got, it was impossible to know how exactly the railway offer was improved. We got no resources to investigate more the impact of the different measures. The only measure that improved the quality of the railway offer in a clear and easy to estimate way was the increase in bicycle and car parking. Without clear indications on how the railway offer improved, it is impossible to determine its impact. It is important to take this into account when interpreting the results.
Another critic on the initial VITO methodology is that it takes a constant baseline over the years. It assumed that without the measure, the amount of railpkm would remain the same between 2005 and 2035. This seems unrealistic taking into account the external environment. In the absence of a clearly defined baseline, we worked with different assumptions and scenarios concerning the baseline (see assumptions) in order to illustrate the uncertainty.",see documentation/source,Federal PAMs impact assessment 2021 (ongoing),www.climat.be/evaluation-PAMs,"2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020","20240,20242,20244,20246,20249,20252,20255,20256,20259,20262,20265,20268,20272",Federal PAMs impact assessment 2021 (ongoing),www.climat.be/evaluation-PAMs,,,2017-2035,,,,,,"Consumer benefits increase till 14.9 M€ in 2035, and the SNCB benefits till 13.9 M€ (Figure 68).

Belgium,29,F-gas action Plan,"The use of fluorinated gases (F-gases) is widespread in industrial and commercial applications. F-gases are greenhouse gases which have a very high global warming effect. To control emissions of F-gases, the EU adopted in 2006 the F-gas Regulation (842/2006), intended to control the production and the consumption of F-gases and incentivize the use of alternatives with less impact on climate change. In 2014, the original F-gases Regulation was replaced by Regulation 517/2014, which strengthen the existent measures and introduced new provisions on F-gases consumption and production, applicable from 2015. The main provisions of the new F-gases Regulation are the following:
- Limitation of the total amount of gases that can be sold in the EU, with the target of reaching an amount of one-fifth of 2014 sales.
- Banning the use of F-gases in certain application where less harmful alternatives are available in the market.
- Preventing the emissions from existent equipment by enhanced maintenance, quality control checks and recovery of gases.
The F-gases regulation impacts on the future evolution of GHG emissions in the following IPCC categories:
- Commercial refrigeration Industrial refrigeration
- Stationary refrigeration
- Domestic refrigeration
- Transport refrigeration
- Foam blowing agents – closed cells Fire protection
- Technical aerosols

The reported impacts are the federal share of the estimated impacts of the F-gas PAM (= 83 %). The assessment of impact of this PAM is based on the study “Projections of fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions in Belgium for the years 2020-2040”14 developed in 2019. This study estimated the F-gases emissions of Belgium up to year 2040 considering the impact of Regulation 517/2014. The estimate carried out in this study is fully consistent with the national GHG emission inventory submitted by Belgium to the UNFCCC (time series 1990-2017), and covers all the gases, emission sources and provisions of the F-gas Regulation.
F-gases projections are developed in a With Existing Measures (WeM) scenario. This means that the historical F-gas emissions of Belgium are projected in one scenario which considers the impact of the regulation, providing the emission levels of the country after the implementation of the Regulation.
This PAM assessment builds from the WeM scenario developed in projections for estimating the impact in terms of GHG emissions reduced of the Regulation 517/2014.

Previously, to assess the impact of this policy, an EU wide study of energy savings achieved with the Ecodesign Directive (VHK, 2016) has been used. To update the assessment of the impact of the policy in Belgium, an updated version of this study is used (VHK, 2020). The scope of the study includes the impact of ecodesign-, labelling- voluntary agreement-, and (past- energy star measures8. The study is updated following Ecodesign review studies, new product groups. Compared to previous editions, it takes into account only the data on products for which a final regulation has been published, with the exception of standard air compressors. It provides energy savings for specific products and appliances types at EU28 level. A BAU (Business As Usual) scenario and a ECO scenario are developed, representing the situation without and with the measures enforced by the Ecodesign Directive. The difference between both is thus representative for the impact of the measures under the Ecodesign requirements.910The study covers 41 product groups with 237 base case products. The study takes into account the ‘noncompliance’ to the Ecodesign Directive, with a first estimate of the savings due to non-compliant products.
The BAU scenario (without Ecodesign & energylabelling measures) it is derived from extrapolating historical trends at the time of the first preparatory study analysis, including ongoing market trends in energy efficiency improvement and emissions abatement (VHK, 2020). This applies mainly to the future years, while historical years in the model are based mostly on actual data (e.g. on the stock, load and energy consumption of products.
For the ECO scenario, the measures prescribed in the Ecodesign, Energy labelling, Energy Star and Tyre labelling impact is modelled. The ECO scenario seek to reflect the final published regulations (VHK, 2020). In that sense, product groups (or usage modes) for which no final regulation has been published have been removed. Data on new measures are inserted when they have been finally decided11. After 2030, the scenarios assume that no further legislation and additional measures taken for new products. will be updated. The consequence is that the effect of measures from 2030-2050 diminishes or tend to flatten (VHK, 2020).
For the calculation of the energy consumption in the different scenarios, the stock and the sales of the different products are modelled. This is combined with the load of each of these appliances and the modelling of the energy efficiency (the ratio between energy input and output, or just the amount of energy use per unit of time), leading to the overall energy consumption per unit of time (here expressed per year). Implicitly all these parameters have their uncertainties and many include assumptions (for instance the future estimation of fuel prices, stock and load of specific appliances, etcetera).
For the assessment of this PAM, we directly use the modelled energy consumption from the Ecodesign Impact Accounting study for both the BAU and ECO scenarios. For more details on the scenarios we refer to VHK (2020). In this study, this impact is only available for the EU as a whole, as no country specific information is available from this study. Therefore, the savings achieved have been downscaled from EU28 level to Belgium, using proxy parameters such as GDP, number of households and final electricity consumption. For heating appliances, a correction for heating degree days was made, noting that the demand for heating in Belgium is different from other European countries under different climate conditions.",see documentation/source,Federal PAMs impact assessment 2021 (ongoing),www.climat.be/evaluation-PAMs,"2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020","20205,20208,20212,20216,20219,20222,20223,20226,20229,20232,20235,20238",Federal PAMs impact assessment 2021 (ongoing),www.climat.be/evaluation-PAMs,,,,,,,,,"The Ecodesign Directive may imply savings from 645.5M€ and 373.4 M€ in 2020 to 1347.3 M€ and 806.4M€ in 2035 for households and the tertiary sector respectively. For the public sectors: implementation costs correspond to 1M€ annually, of which 19% corresponds to employment costs and 81% verification test costs.

The BAU scenario does not take into account that some people will improve energy efficiency in their house even if no tax reductions and subsidies are available (freerider effect), while the PAM scenario does not take a possible multiplier effect into account.

FPS Economy provided information on the number of green loans for the period 2009-2018. The period from 2012 is considered the phasing-out period, as it is no longer possible to benefit from the system with new loans from 1 January 2012. However, old loans continue to benefit from the tax advantage and have gradually been decreasing since 2012.
To allocate the number of loans to the different technologies, the distribution observed in measure EC-B03 (FRGE, all applications) was used. This is a different distribution than for measure EC-B01, which reflects the fact that costly investments (e.g. PV panels) are more likely to occur proportionally for a loan.
The unit emission reductions of measure EC-B01 are used also in this PAM.
Finally, part of the emission reduction was allocated to the regional level (corresponding to financial support provided by grants and green certificates). To estimate the financial contribution of the Federal government, we calculated the benefit of a 1.5% reduction of the interest rate on a loan (mean cost for different technologies based on information of FRGE) for a period of 5 years.",see documentation/source,Federal PAMs impact assessment 2021 (ongoing),www.climat.be/evaluation-PAMs,"2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020","20128,20129,20132,20135,20136,20140,20143,20144,20147,20151,20154,20155",Federal PAMs impact assessment 2021 (ongoing),www.climat.be/evaluation-PAMs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Belgium,152,Brussels Green certificates,Principle of a system of green certificates : 1. A green certificate is allocated to a producer of green electricity (including combined heat and power) every time its production avoids the emission of 217 kg of CO2- if it had to be produced in a reference fossil fuel plant (natural gas : combined cycle gas turbine) 2. Each year- a predefined (and annually increasing) percentage of electricity supplied to end users has to be covered by green electricity. Suppliers must restitute the necessary number of green certificates to demonstrate that they respect that rule. In case of failure- a penalty fee is due. This situation creates a market for green certificates for the benefit of green electricity producers.  Shares are regularly updated by regional regulation authorities. 3. The final cost of this system is borne by the final consumer through a tariff overload. - The Brussels NECP plans to evaluate the green certicates system in line with the evolution of renewable energy systems cost.

Belgium,213,Cash for cars and mobility budget,"In March 2018, the ‘cash for car’ system was put in place, to enable employees to exchange their company cars for a mobility allowance. In complement in March 2019, a 2nd alternative for the company car was introduced, the 'mobility budget'. The employee who wishes to trade in his car for cash or a mobility budget must have had a car for at least 12 months during the past 3 years, of which 3 months uninterruptedly before the application for the allowance. At the same time, the employer must have a system of company cars in place for at least 3 years. The mobility allowance and mobility budget only apply to employees.
The mobility budget is equal to the annual gross cost of the company car the employee is entitled to at the moment of the request. The employee can choose or combine from 3 different options: 1) use an environmentally friendly company car, emitting a maximum of 100 grams CO2 per km2, 2) a budget, free of tax, to spend on sustainable modes of transport (purchase and maintenance of (electric) bicycles, electric motorcycles, public transport, sharing solutions, housing costs), 3) the remainder of the mobility budget will be paid in cash to the employee at the end of the year, without income tax but with a social security tax of 38,07%.
As of the 1st of January 2021, the ‘cash for car’ system is no longer in place.

The main actions implemented to reach this goal were the following: 
•	Renewal and modernization of lighting installation systems for railway stations, offices, and other building services
•	Continuation of the renewal of heating systems in buildings
•	Replacement of old production facilities with more energy efficient one
•	Restoration of existing buildings (isolation, etc.)

The design capacity of a 12-hour reception of household waste is 390 tonnes a day or 140,000 tonnes a year. The facility performs pre-treatment of waste by way of separation. In separation, first eligible composting waste is removed from the rest. Then the process of separation continues to achieve separation of other waste types, namely ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics, wood waste, glass, paper and cardboard. The separation is done by weighting principle, by size and by composition of waste. Separated fractions for composting are treated in a controlled environment, while aerobic treatment is carried out in closed tunnels.Another big facility for MBT treatment of household waste runs in the village of Shishmantsi, in the region of Plovdiv, which is in operation since 2009. This MBT plant has an annual capacity of 125,000 tonnes per year and serves the municipalities of the Regional Waste Management System (RWMS) Plovdiv.

BIOLOGICAL RECLAMATION WITH TYPICAL FOR THE REGION GRASS SPECIES 2.IMPLEMENTATION OF EROSION CONTROL MEASURES AND SOIL TREATMENT METHODS,"Soil erosion is a process of mechanical destruction and weathering of soil by the action of water and wind. It gradually reduces the amount of nutrients and the humus in soil. Erosion aggravates the structure, as well as the water and air regime of soil. The combination of the specific natural and economic conditions in Bulgaria is a reason for the high risk of degradation processes in agricultural soils. The most common processes of soil degradation include water and wind erosion, pollution, reduction of organic matter stocks (humus), compaction, acidification, salinisation, loss of biodiversity. More than 60% of the country is affected by varying degrees of erosion. 11.8 % of the country’s territory is severely eroded. 65% of agricultural land is threatened by water erosion and 24% is threatened by wind erosion. The average annual intensity of soil erosion varies according to land use, but soil loss in agricultural lands is estimated at 12.256 tonnes/ha a year on average. The water erosion of soil controls the stocks of organic carbon and their distribution on the landscape which affects the circulation of carbon, the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the global warming.The proposed budget for the measure is based on reclamation of 2500 ha:- 2500 ha ? 380 BGN/ha = 950 000 BGNErosion control practices for 2500 ha- 2500 ha ? 145 BGN/ha = 362 500 BGNThe amounts used are under the current Measure 214 Agri-environmental payments under RDP 2007-2013",National,Single,519,Single PaM,Economic,Implemented,ESD/ESR,Agriculture,"Agriculture: Activities improving grazing land or grassland management,Agriculture: Improved management of organic soils",20 000 total reduction in tonnes ??2 eq. by 2020,CO2; N2O; CH4,,,,,National government,National government: Ministry of agriculture;  food and forestry; National government: Ministry of environment and water,2013,2030,Yes,"Common Agricultural Policy, and its delegated and implementing acts ",No information,With existing measures,ha with  implemented control  erosion practices; ha,under consideration,"In RDP 2014-2020 to measure 04 Investments in tangible assets includes sub-measure 4.4 Non-production investments.

In Croatia, the problem is that unused pastures and meadows cover a large area of ??agricultural land. In order to reduce costs, extensive fattening on pastures is becoming increasingly important. Numerous variables are included in determining the number of animals (conditional head / ha) that can be on pasture without causing damage to natural resources: soil, climate, plant composition, species and age of livestock, water availability, sensitive areas (too steep) , endangered species, wetlands, etc.), general soil condition and types of livestock production.
Given the import of a large number of calves for fattening or fattened cattle and meat, the establishment of a cow-calf system imposes itself as a logical solution and source of calves that can later be fed on the same farms (pasture fattening) or fattened in specialized fattening farms.

Croatia,59,"MAG-5: Improving the breeding and selection program, animal health and welfare","Main activity in this measure is research aimed at determining the variation in the predicted CH4 emission and determining the genetic potential for reducing methane emissions in dairy cows as well as increased production intensity.
Genetic potential and type of individuals (breeding and selection work) - Intensive selection to increase productivity - higher production achieves indirect effects -  fewer animals and less food consumption . Furthermore, higher food utilization results in reduced excretion of N compounds in faeces and urine, but also reduces excretion and thus their potential emission. A positive genetic correlation between PME (predicted methane emissions) and RFI (residual feed intake) shows that cows with lower RFI also have lower potential emissions. Thus, it is possible to reduce methane production in cows by selecting genetically more suitable cows with respect to methane emissions. Genetic variability assumes a reduction of 11-26% over a ten-year period, but can also be increased by applying a selection program. However, there are several doubts, such as the lack of accurate methane measurements (and the main assumption is that methane produced per unit of food does not affect RFI levels), as well as predicting the possible consequences of genetic selection.

Croatia,84,"MCC-8: Creation of Platform for Carbon Capture, Use and Storage","The carbon capture and storage technology for large emission sources is not yet commercially available. According to Directive 2009/31/EC on geological storage of carbon dioxide, i.e. Article 36 of Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions, for power plants with a capacity of more than 300 MW that have received a building permit after the entry into force of Directive 2009/31/EC on geological storage of carbon dioxide, it is necessary to assess whether the following conditions are met: a) availability of a suitable storage location, b) technical and economic feasibility of transport facilities and c) technical and economic feasibility of upgrading the CO2 capture and collection facility. If these conditions are met, the competent authority must provide adequate space at the installation site for equipment to capture and compress the extracted CO2. Legislatively, this is covered by the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Exploitation Act (OG 52/18, 52/19), which enables the storage of CO2 in the territory of the Republic of Croatia. In accordance with the above, it is planned to prepare a study of storage capacity assessment, but also to prepare a National Feasibility Study with an action plan for preparatory activities for CCUS projects.

Denmark,1,1-TD-01b: Mineral-oil Tax Act,"Tax on mineral oil products in Denmark. The Mineral-oil Tax Act entered into force on 1 January 1993. Before this, the tax on petrol was regulated via the Petrol Tax Act, which entered into force on 1 January 1983, and the Act on Taxation of Gas Oil and Diesel Oil, Heating Oil, Heating Tar, and Crude Oil was regulated via the Act on Taxation of certain Oil Products, which entered into force on 3 October 1977. From 1 June 1999 a tax differentiation between light diesel and diesel low in sulphur was introduced, to encourage the use of diesel low in sulphur, which is less polluting than light diesel. This was accomplished and a change took place soon after to the effect that almost all diesel sold was low in sulphur. The purpose of further differentiation from 1 January 2005 favouring sulphur-free diesel was likewise to encourage the use of this type of diesel in favour of diesel low in sulphur, and this has been successful. In addition, tax differentiation has been introduced in order to achieve environmental goals other than direct reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

As of 1 January 2011 a tax on methane emissions - equal in terms of CO2 equivalents to the CO2 tax - from natural gas fired power plants was introduced. This is expected to reduce methane emissions from gas engines through behavioural changes such as changing from motor operation to boiler operation and establishing mitigation measures. Consumption is also expected to fall as the price of heat will increase. These behavioural changes will result in falls in the emissions of unburned methane from power stations. In addition, CO2 emissions will fall and consumption of natural gas will fall.

The EU Member States progress with this trading scheme for greenhouse gas emissions in order to fulfil the international climate commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol and Paris agreement, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions from covered installations and flights. The installations subject to EU ETS covers about half of Danish emissions of greenhouse gases. Statutory and administrative basis for the scheme have been established. Allowances prices have particular significance for Danish emissions as they affect the need to initiate other mitigation initiatives. Introducing the Marked Stability Reserve has had major impact on price levels thus supporting national efforts.  Efforts to further increase the level of ambition in EU climate policy are key in the Danish government’s climate change policy to achieve ambitious national targets. The legislative framework of the EU ETS (2021-2030) was revised in early 2018 to enable it to achieve the EU's 2030 emission reduction targets.

Denmark,23,2-EN-06: Energy development and demonstration,"Danish support for new energy technologies has been comprehensive and relatively stable. The creation of a domestic market has given Danish companies a boost. This boost has enabled many companies to become international market leaders. . R&D activities include energy savings, more efficient energy conversion, renewable energy technologies and efforts within System Integration and Smart Energy.
The Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Programme (EUDP) was established in 2007 and since then the programme has supported more than 1000 projects with a total of DDK 5 billion. On average, 50% of the activities under the Programme are financed by the EUDP and hence the private investments in the supported projects are of the same size as the public support leading to approximately to DKK 10 billion in total investments. The Danish Parliament has dedicated DKK 520 million for EUDP for the fiscal year 2021.
In 2018, the energy and climate research was strengthened with the 2018 Energy Agreement with the intention to phase in additional state funding going from 580m DKK in 2020 to a target of 1 billion DKK annually from 2024. 
The research funding will support Denmark’s commitment to the international collaboration Mission Innovation. With an ambitious funding target of 1 billion DKK from 2024 onwards, Denmark further cements its long-term commitment to research, development and demonstration in the field of energy and climate.

The Danish authorities have recently rejected KL’s plan for adjustment of the Danish waste incineration capacity within a specific framework specified in the Climate plan. According to the Climate plan, a supply-based model will now be implemented instead. The Climate plan specifies that:  
• The environmental requirements for waste incineration plants will be tightened so that plants that lag behind environmentally will either invest in technological improvements or close. The tightening of these measures will be subject to a prior analysis determining which environmental parameters to tighten, as well as a legal clarification of the possibilities.
• In the event that the capacity for waste incineration does not progress in accordance with the development in the waste quantities, a tax on waste incineration will be introduced (e.g. per tonne of waste for incineration or targeted plastic), unless an alternative instrument proves to be better suited, including e.g. CO2 requirements or requirements for plastic content in the sorted waste for incineration.

Denmark,32,3-BU-10: The center for energy savings in enterprises,"Reducing energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency and promoting energy saving is a very important element for Danish energy policy.
Among the grid and distribution companies (electricity, natural gas, oil and heating), the electricity companies have been working with energy savings since the early 1990s and the natural gas and district heating companies have been working with energy savings since 2000. 
Since 2006, several political agreements have been reached to significantly strengthen the energy savings efforts in Denmark. The obligations have been implemented as voluntary agreements between the Minister of Energy, Utilities and Climate and grid and distribution companies. Energy companies’ costs are financed by a levy on their tariffs. 

In December 2016, the Minister of Energy, Utilities and Climate entered a new agreement on energy savings with the grid and distribution companies for the period 2016-2020.

All new buildings must, according to the Danish building code, be constructed as nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB).
The benefits of reducing energy consumption are tangible: less fossil fuel is consumed and the environment has improved substantially. Strict and progressively tightened building regulations since 1977 have ensured a stable demand for energy-efficient building technologies.
Energy labelling of buildings must be implemented after finishing the construction of a building and on the sale or rental of the building - primarily heating consumption. This applies in principle for all buildings, irrespective of size, apart from production facilities, factories etc. The energy performance is expressed by a numeric indicator of primary energy in kWh/m2 per year based on the primary energy factor.
The Energy Performing Certificate (EPC) consist of an energy label and an energy plan. For publicly owned buildings over 250 m2 the EPC must be prepared regularly every ten years.

The ban has resulted in greater return of carbon to the soil, and therefore increased carbon storage in the soil, as well as increased use of straw as a fuel. Both uses will result in a net reduction in CO2 emissions. Not burning straw prevents the methane and nitrous oxide emissions associated with the burning. On the other hand, there are some emissions of nitrous oxide in connection with the return of nitrogen to the soil when the straw is mulched. The measure works by regulating behaviour, and the ban was introduced from 1990.

Denmark,91,9-WA-04 (expired): Subsidy programme – Enterprise Scheme (special scheme for businesses),"In 2005 the Programme for Cleaner Products etc. was replaced by the Danish government’s “Enterprise Scheme” which refunds CO2 taxes to business. The waste part of this programme was aimed exclusively at enterprises. A total of DKK 33 million for the five-year period 2004 to 2008 was earmarked for the waste part of the scheme. The subsidies were to be used to reduce the environmental impact of waste. Two projects with reduction of methane emissions were supported: a. To address the obstacles and to improve the method, another biocover-project was initiated in 2007 as part of the Enterprise Scheme. The project was performed on another landfill (i.e. not the landfill in the biocover-pilotproject 2005-2006 carried out with support from Danish EPA and the EU LIFE programme), and was taking the identified difficulties into account. A reduction of the methane emission of 79-93 % was reported in the project. b. In 2007 subsidies from the enterprise scheme were also given for establishing methane recovery and test pumping at 11 landfill sites. The results were reported in 2011 and showed a reduction of the emission of methane over a five year period equalling 84,435 tonnes of CO2 equivalents.

France,111,Aides au développement des infrastructures de charge pour véhicule électrique : obligation de pré-équipements dans certains types de bâtiments neufs et soutien financier à l'installation des bornes de recharge publiques et privées,"Le développement des bornes de recharge repose sur un ensemble de mesures. La loi de transition énergétique pour la croissance verte a créé des obligations de pré-équipements de certains types de bâtiments. Toute construction de certains types de bâtiments équipés d’un parc de stationnement (habitation, tertiaire, industriel, accueillant un service public, constituant un ensemble commercial, cinéma), doit doter une partie de ces places de stationnement de  gaines techniques, câblages et dispositifs de sécurité nécessaires à l’alimentation d’une prise de recharge pour véhicule électrique ou hybride rechargeable . Il en va de même lorsque sont réalisés des  travaux sur un parc de stationnement annexe  à ces mêmes types de bâtiments. La loi d'orientation des mobilités mobilités renforce ces obligations en rendant obligatoire le prééquipement de bornes de recharge électrique dans tous les parkings de plus de dix places des bâtiments neufs ou rénovés, et l’équipement de tous les parkings de plus de 20 places des bâtiments non résidentiels d’ici 2025. Le droit à la prise, qui permet à un citoyen résidant en logement collectif de faire installer, à ses frais, une borne de recharge individuelle dans son parking, sera simplifié et étendu aux parkings extérieurs. Par ailleurs l’installation de bornes de recharge bénéficie de soutiens financiers:- Pour les particuliers l’installation de bornes de recharge pour les voitures est éligible au crédit d’impôt pour la transition énergétique à hauteur de 30 % des dépenses engagées. - Les projets d’installation de bornes de recharges publiques par les collectivités locales ont bénéficié de subventions, grâce au fonds du PIA (Programme d’Investissements d’Avenir). - Le programme CEE-ADVENIR vient couvrir les coûts de fourniture et d’installation de points de recharge à hauteur de 40 % pour les entreprises et les personnes publiques et de 50 % pour le résidentiel collectif dans la limite de plafonds par point de recharge et par type de cible. Le décret IRVE relatif aux infrastructures de recharge (12 janvier 2017) a par ailleurs uniformisé dans un texte unique l'ensemble des dispositions relatives aux infrastructures de recharge pour véhicules électrique et intégré diverses mesures réglementaires issues de la directive 2014/94/UE. Ce décret comporte plusieurs points : exigences minimales requises pour la configuration des points de recharge normale et rapide ; dispositions relatives à la gestion de lénergie ; dispositions relatives à l'exploitation des infrastructures de recharge (généralisation des identifiants, supervision, interopérabilité) ; communication des données relatives aux caractéristiques et à la disponibilité des infrastructures de recharge ; dispositions relatives à l'accès aux infrastructures et au paiement de la recharge ; dispositions relatives à la qualification des installateurs et à la maintenance des infrastructures de recharge.

Greece,4,Promotion of natural gas in industry,"The introduction of natural gas in the national energy system is one of the largest investments ever carried out in Greece and it constitutes a major priority of the national energy policy. An important part of the infrastructure, mainly the high pressure transmission system and the medium pressure network, which is necessary for the transport of natural gas to the main regions of consumption, has been completed. Hundreds of industrial plants use natural gas covering efficiently their energy needs. Expansion projects of Greek natural gas system are under way in order to link more industries to the system. The industry sector is the second-largest consumer of natural gas, accounting for 29% of the total gas demand in 2015. This includes natural gas used as petrochemical feedstock in the chemical and petrochemical industry, which represents almost half of industrial gas consumption. The non-ferrous metals industry (e.g. aluminium) is the largest consumer of natural gas for energy purposes in the industry sector, accounting for nearly one-third of the total gas consumption in industry.The actions for the promotion of NG are summarized to the following bullets: (a) Pricing (always lower price than the competitive liquid fuels, valid for all sectors); (b) Discount on connection fees; (c) Heavy marketing through TV commercial, ads, etc., focusing on the increased efficiency, economy and environmental “friendliness” of natural gas; (d) Availability of natural gas through continuous development of networks (infrastructure); (e) Liberalization of electricity and natural gas markets; (f) Emission Trading System; (g) Restriction of environmental permits to industrial installations (e.g. prohibition of petcoke use by the ceramics production units).",National,Single,530,Single PaM,Economic; Information; Regulatory,Implemented,EU ETS; ESD/ESR,Energy Consumption,Energy Consumption: Efficiency improvement in industrial end-use sectors,,CO2,832,970,,,National government,National government: Ministry of Environment and Energy,1996,,Yes,"EU ETS directive 2003/87/EC as amended by Directive 2008/101/EC, Directive 2009/29/EC and Directive 2018/410 and implementing legislation, in particular 2010/2/EU, 2011/278/EU, 2011/638/EU, 176/2014/EU, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814Â ;Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC, ESD Annual Emission Allocation (AEA) Decision 2013/634/EU and Commission Decision (EU) 2017/1471 amending Decision 2013/162/EUÂ ;Industrial emissions Directive 2010/75/EU (Recast of IPPC Directive 2008/1/EC and Large Combustion Plant Directive 2001/80/EC) and its associated Best Available Technique Reference DocumentsÂ ;Directive 2006/32/EC on end-use energy efficiency and energy services;Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU as amended by Directive 2018/2002 ",Yes,With existing measures,Fuel input TJ,"This PaM contributes to the reduction of GHG emissions and the respective target of both ETS and ESR sectors in NECP and long-term strategy.

Whale watching boats and other smaller boats which sail shorter distances with tourists, to and from the same port, could for example possibly be electrified. Unlike the larger fishing ships, tourism boats which do many trips a day, would need access to fast charging stations, which are currently not very common. It has been proposed that projects regarding alterations to the ships and land based infrastructure will also have the possibility to apply for grants.

In 1997 ESD emissions from fish meal factories was at its highest, at over 180 kt. It had, however, been reduced to 12  kt in 2019. It must be ensured that this development continues and does not suffer from any setbacks by working on quitting the burning of fossil fuels in fish meal factories completely. One of the measures that will be taken is establishing how electricity security can be increased in the places where fish meal factories are operating, how other technological hindrances such as local loop can be overcome, and how it can be ensured that the price of electricity to fish meal factories is cost-effective compared to oil.

This policy is based on a principle and how it develops will depend on technological advancement. It is, therefore, expected that there will be some exceptions to the rule, for example due to regional perspectives or for the vehicles of first-responders. The policy also only affects new registrations of diesel- or gas fueled vehicles, it will still be permitted to drive, buy and sell used diesel- or gas fueled vehicles. The ban only applies to the import of new vehicles which are only fueled by fossil fuels. Hereby a significant step is taken in the direction of phasing out fossil fueled vehicles completely. Various other countries, including the UK, France and Norway, have set targets for banning the new registration of fossil fueled vehicles at a certain time.The signal this policy sends to car manufacturers is very important because plans to produce specific car types is are made in the long term. It is, therefore, important that governments all around the world set targets for when markets for fossil fueled cars will either shrink significantly or close entirely.

Iceland,206,Encouraging public transport,"Public transport will be promoted and supported in all Iceland. The government and six municipalities in the capital signed an agreement in September 2019 with an ambitious plan to build up transport infrastructure and public transportation in the capital area in the next 15 years. The agreement contains the most extensive transportation construction plan in the history of Iceland. The goal is to greatly boost public transport. improve transport for all modes of transportation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach the government´s and municipalities´ climate goals, reduce traffic jams etc. Borgarlínan is a part of the agreement and the preparations for construction are currently underway. Borgarlínan will be a new transportation system with separate priority lanes at traffic lights and frequent trips. In addition, the public transport will use domestic renewable fuels, such as electricity, hydrogen or methane. The construction of 42 km of Borgarlínan routes, reaching most of the capital area, has been agreed upon.

All government/state owned cars will be sustainable as a rule, the only exceptions being if safety- or usage purposes require something else. State entities will, therefore, not purchase new fossil fueled cars as a main rule from 2020. The Icelandic government approved this policy in 2019. Central public procurement (Ríkiskaup) and a so-called car committee are responsible for implementing the new procurement procedures, and the organisations which intend to purchase vehicles are bound to participate in common tenders where the tender descriptions ensure that sustainable and economical cars will be purchased such as electric, hydrogen or methane fueled vehicles. The state runs approximately 800 vehicles of various shapes and sizes. This measure aims to transform the vehicle fleet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to pave the way for a ban on the new registration of gas- and diesel cars (see measure 204).

Energy sources in ferries which are in regular operation will be switched out for more sustainable non-fossil fueled options where technological development allows it. There are five ferries currently in operation in Iceland, three of those are state owned. 1. Herjólfur , the Westman Island ferry. The new Herjólfur is a hybrid and it is expected that the ship will sail completely on electricity from the Icelandic coast to the Westman Islands. The first trip running completely on electricity was undertaken on the 1st of January 2020. 2. Sævar, the ferry to Hrísey. The ferry will be renewed as an electric ferry. It is expected that the design process can begin late in 2024. 3. Sæfari, the ferry to Grímsey. When the ferry needs to be renewed alternative energy sources than fossil fuels will be considered. Two ferries are privately owned. 4. The ferry in Mjóifjörður. This is a small ferry which the owner is interested in electrifying. 5. Baldur, the ferry in Breiðarfjörður. This is a ferry owned by the company Eimskip/Sæferðir.

The goal is to increase the share of active modes of transportation and enable more people to choose that option. Laws have already been updated and VAT on all bikes, electric bikes and electric scooters has been canceled. The changes went through on January 1st 2020. The updated law states that all types of bikes should be subsidized if they will promote increased outdoor activity, improve public health and reduce road transport.

Iceland,210,Energy transition in heavy transport,"Decrease GHG emissions from heavy goods transportation by accelerating energy change in that sector. GHG emissions per heavy vehicle (over 3,5 tonnes) are multiple times more than per passenger vehicle and they drive proportionately more. In the year 2018, approximately 15% of road transport emissions were caused by heavy goods transportation. Each additional sustainable vehicle is therefore significant. The main obstacles to energy change in heavy goods transportation are a lack of fuel supply and supply of longer distance vehicles, a lack of infrastructure and consequently a lack of demand for sustainable vehicles. It will be the role of a project management team on energy change to consult with stakeholders and get recommendations on which energy change projects should be the main focus to accelerate the switch to clean energy or sustainable fuels in heavy goods transport. The project management team will continue to work with the proposals made by Græna orkan in February 2020. The project management team will then put forward their suggestions on priority projects, including heavy goods transportation, for the years 2021-2023 by the 1st of December 2020.

Car rentals are responsible for the purchasing of 40% of new cars in Iceland, the highest share in the world. In 2018 approximately 60% of travellers rented a car during their visit to Iceland. According to an analysis by Íslensk NýOrka, which was conducted during Iceland´s presidency of the Nordic Council of Ministers (Norræna ráðherranefndin) in 2019, most car rental companies have a strong interest in adopting clean energy cars in their operations. There are, however, various obstacles to this development. This measure‘s primary aim is to analyse the main obstacles and opportunities to accelerate energy change in the car fleets of car rental companies through a comprehensive needs- and costs analysis. The measure is connected to measure 201 on concessions for climate friendly vehicles, because with the changes which took effect at the beginning of 2020 to accelerate energy change in road transport, renting out sustainable cars became exempt from VAT turnover.

Furthermore, a decision has been taken on building a new marine research ship and the tender for its build is currently being prepared. An emphasis was put on saving energy and limiting the environmental impact in the design process. Other energy saving methods in ships will also be used, such as using LED lighting and the cooling water for the diesel engine for heating. It is also assumed that the ship will be equipped with engines which can be powered not only by fossil-fuels, but also by bio fuels and possibly methanol. It will, however, be decided through the development process of a four-speed engine of the size required by the ship, whether it will be possible to equip it with such an engine.

Certain other provisions are made in the regulation which aim to further reduce F-gas emissions, such as limits on their marketing and use. Refilling big systems with F-gases which have a very high global warming potential (maximum 2500 GWP) will be banned.

Reykjavík Energy (Orkuveita Reykjavíkur) has developed the method in collaboration with the University of Iceland and foreign stakeholders and it has received widespread attention around the world. The method involves capturing CO2 from geothermal emissions. The CO2 dissolves in water under pressure and the water is subsequently pumped to a depth of 500-800 meters into the basalt strata, where the CO2 is permanently mineralized. The gas is, in this way, turned into rock. ON, a subsidiary of Reykjavík Energy, has used the method for the last years to reduce emissions from Hellisheiði Geothermal Power Plant with good results. Recently Iceland implemented in the Icelandic law (No 12 from 18 March 2021) an Icelandic adaptation of Directive 2009/31/EC (the CCS Directive) with the aim to enable the EU ETS industry in Iceland to utilize the Carbfix method within the CCS.",National,Single,606,Single PaM,Regulatory,Implemented,EU ETS,Energy Supply,Energy Supply: Carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and utilization,This is not a quantifiable measure at this stage.,CO2,,,,,National government,National government: Ministry of the Environment;  Energy and Climate,2021,,Yes,Directive on the geological storage of CO2 2009/31/EC ,No,No information,,"This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the livestock chew and process food they belch out methane. Research, that has been conducted abroad, indicates that it is possible to reduce methane production in the digestive system of livestock in various ways, such as through using substances made from algae. Whether it is possible to reduce emissions from enteric fermentation in Iceland through such means will be explored, and domestic research and development will be supported. The implementation of this policy is aligned with policy 401 on Climate-friendly agriculture and policy 404 on Carbon-neutral beef production, part of which is to assess the status and development of research on enteric fermentation.

An important aspect of this effort is to enforce the regulation on protection against water pollution due to nitrogen compounds (NOx) from agriculture and other operations (Icelandic regulation No. 796/1999). The policy scope includes the fertilizer use of all farmers, but it will begin with cattle- and sheep farmers since measures in those fields have already begun (see policies 401 and 402). Through those measures farmers will, among other things, be provided with advice that aims to improve the use of manure, and it will be researched systematically how farmers use their manure.

To reach the target, research, counselling and education for farmers will be increased. First, cattle farmers’ knowledge on carbon emissions and sequestration, improved feeding and manure management techniques, will be built up. The foundation will be knowing the possibilities of each plot of farmland and to build up a transparent and certified framework for the project. The preparation for this project is ongoing and a management group with representatives from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, the Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate and the Farmers Association of Iceland (Bændasamtök Íslands) has proposed a variety of measures, in consultation with RML, The University of Agriculture, Matís (Icelandic Food and Biotech R&D) and more.

Production of Icelandic vegetables will be increased by 25% in the next 3 years. Organic vegetable production will receive increased financial support and efforts will be made for Icelandic horticulture to become carbon neutral no later than 2040. This was agreed upon when the contract for the operation conditions of horticulture production (horticulture contract)  was reviewed in May 2020. To support carbon neutrality in Icelandic horticulture by the year 2040, a part of the funding for the horticulture contract will be spent specifically on climate action. Knowledge on carbon emissions and sequestration will be increased, the treatment and use of resources and fertilisers will be improved, waste will be reduced, and an emphasis will be placed on effective agriculture, increased sustainability and other actions that support reaching the target of carbon neutral farming. A holistic approach will be undertaken, focusing on policy strategy in climate-, energy-, employment- and regional affairs, among other significant issues. Farmers’ knowledge on climate issues, and possibilities to reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon sequestration, will be improved further. This will be achieved, partly by increasing farmers’ access to direct council and education. The emphasis will be on knowing the possibilities of each individual horticultural farm directly, and to build up a transparent and certified framework for the project.

Provisions in the bill specify that a special collection of bio and biological waste shall be set afoot and that landfilling this waste will be prohibited.  This is a change in the legislation and it the goal of the law is, among other things, to create conditions that support a circular economy. The provisions are meant to lead to the sorting of bio waste from other waste in the whole country and it being prepared for reuse or recycling, in line with the how the treatment of waste is prioritized. In the capital area bio waste will be diverted to the gas- and composting plant of Sorpa, at least in part, but in the countryside it is more likely that bio waste will be used for composting as a rule.

The Ministry of Education and Children will use the mapping and further direct it to the Directorate of Education to use it to develop and revise education materials. It is expected that various educational projects will be presented in the near future (see measure 707 on climate education for the public), and that a part of them will be useful for the entire educational system.
When the education system‘s curriculum is reviewed next, climate change education will be made a priority and educational grants will be allocated by the Ministry of Education and Children to climate education projects. Education on climate change will be increased at all educational levels and provided through various educational channels. The goal is for schools to be able to offer varied and comprehensive education on climate change, its consequences and what we can do to combat it, in line with the sustainability principle which lays at the core of all education. 
A contract has been signed with the NGO Landvernd on creating educational material on climate change and climate issues for schools. The education material is connected to the project Eco-Schools Iceland which has been running in Iceland since 2001 and currently reaches over 200 schools at all education levels. The project is part of to the world’s largest environmental education organisation, the Foundation for Environmental Eduaction (FEE).",National,Single,606,Single PaM,Education,Implemented,ESD/ESR; EU ETS; LULUCF,Other Sectors,Other Sectors: New objective(s),A quantified objective is not available.,CO2; HFC; CH4; NF3; N2O; PFC; SF6,,,,,National government,National government: Ministry for the Environment;  Energy and Climate,2019,,No,No information,No,No information,,"This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iceland,707,Information on climate change for the public,"Education on climate issues will be supported in a variety of ways. Since the first edition of the Climate Action Plan (2018) was published, several new projects have been set afoot. The education system plays an important role in raising awareness in the younger generations and collaboration with education authorities is essential. Ways to further support education on climate issues, the impacts of consumerism and waste, will be explored. A mapping of the education material that is currently available to the public in Iceland has been undertaken by the Ministry of Education and Children and will lay the foundations for this.
One of the roles of the Climate Fund, which was established in the autumn of 2019 (see measure 703), is to support education on climate issues and the impacts of climate change. The government has, furthermore, directly funded several educational projects on climate issues and will continue to do so.

A regulation on the reporting of environmental data will be developed to coordinate information and simplify the reporting process for operators. The goal is to receive more detailed data from the operators that are bound to report environmental data, in order to have better information on resource use and pollution in Iceland. A regulation on ”emissions accounts“ (icel. útstreymisbókhald), Regulation No 990/2008, will build on the same base as the Regulation on Green Accounts No 851/2002 and weave in further provisions to ensure that all data that the Environment Agency of Iceland needs to fulfil its legal obligations, such as reporting to EFTA's regulatory agency and the UNFCCC, is gathered and reported.

The National Planning Agency‘s proposal was presented to the Minister in the spring of 2021.
The National Planning Strategy contains the government´s policy and guidance for municipalities’ planning. The policy update focuses on how the planning of municipalities can purposefully support the achievement of the government’s climate-, landscape- and public health targets. In the update, guidance is proposed on how municipalities can use long-term planning strategies to shape the development of land-use and the built environment, both in rural and urban areas. The policy expects municipalities to form a policy on climate focused planning, in order for planning to support the achievement of carbon neutrality and to strengthen resilience against climate change through various adaptation measures. The measure is connected to various other measures in the Action Plan, such as measures 601, 602 and 604 on supporting forestry, land- and wetland reclamation, and measures 205, 206 and 209 on changed travel habits, active modes of transportation and the strengthening of the public transport system.",National,Single,606,Single PaM,Planning,Implemented,ESD/ESR; LULUCF,Other Sectors,Other Sectors: New objective(s),A quantified objective is not available.,CO2; CH4; N2O,,,,,National government,National government: Ministry for the Environment;  Energy and Climate,2021,,No,No information,No,No information,,"This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.","https://www.landsskipulag.is/media/pdf-skjol/Landsskipulagsstefna2015-2026_asamt_greinargerd.pdf

Iceland,710,Climate impact of the construction industry,"Identify opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building industry. Greenhouse gas emissions from the construction industry will be systematically reduced. It is difficult to assess the climate impact of the construction industry from the National Inventory, but the main emissions occur during construction and are caused by the choice and import of construction materials and the use of heavy machinery, for example to transport minerals. Only emissions from a small part of this, that is the use of heavy machinery, falls under Iceland‘s ESD emissions.  After the first edition of the Climate Action Plan (2018) was published, the Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Climate initiated a lot of research into the climate- and environmental impacts of the construction industry. Examples of the research which was undertaken include the climate impacts of the constructon industry, life cycle analysis, the treatment of waste and frost proof sustainable concrete. 
A proposal for a new plan is expected to be handed over to the Ministries no later than the 1st of November 2020. Among the measures which will be explored is whether all public buildings should be required to have environmental certifications (such as for example Svansvottun).",National,Single,606,Single PaM,Planning; Regulatory,Implemented,ESD/ESR,Energy Consumption,Energy Consumption: Efficiency improvements of buildings,A quantified objective is not available.,CO2,,,,,National government,National government: Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour,2020,,Yes,Effort Sharing Regulation EU 2018/842Â and implementing decision on ESR Annual Emission AllocationsÂ  ,No,No information,,"This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iceland,711,Issuing of green bonds,"The feasibility of issuing green government bonds and opening pathways to green investors for conventional government loans will be explored. There are possibilities to finance well defined sustainable projects through issuing certain green government bonds. This would send a clear signal to investors about the importance of environmental issues and how the finance sector could support climate change prevention. The issuing of green bonds has been increasing on international markets in the past years and there has been more pressure on investors to direct investment to projects that support reaching long term sustainability and climate targets.
The Icelandic Treasury has hitherto not issued green bonds, but a project management group set up by the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs is now assessing what possibilities are available.  The group was set up in June 2020 and consists of representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Climate, the Prime Minister‘s Office, and the Central Bank of Iceland.",National,Single,606,Single PaM,Economic,Implemented,ESD/ESR; LULUCF,Other Sectors,Other Sectors: New objective(s),A quantified objective is not available.,CO2; HFC; CH4; NF3; N2O; PFC; SF6,,,,,National government,National government: Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (FJR),2021,,No,No information,No,No information,,"This is not applicable to Iceland, see EEA Joint Committee Decision 269/2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Central Public Procurement developed a new public procurement policy on Sustainable procurement which was published in January 2021. The government procures goods and services for 117 billion ISK every year, which allows for many opportunities to form a clear environmental policy regarding procurement. Creating a demand for more environmentally friendly goods and services can have significant direct and indirect effects on the market and help pave the way for other businesses or organisations to do the same thing.
The Icelandic government furthermore purchases food for approximately 3 billion ISK per year and can, as a big buyer, have a significant impact on food demand, support sustainable procurement, reduce the carbon footprint and support innovation. In the procurement policy for food for government agencies, which the Ministry of Industries and Innovation published in May 2019, an emphasis is placed on altering procurement processes so that cafeterias have access to package free food and that a public calculator for the carbon footprint of food will be designed. It has been declared that the goal is to keep the consumption of red meat in moderation.

All government agencies, municipalities and government majority owned companies shall, by law, develop a climate policy and set itself a GHG emission reduction target. The Environment Agency of Iceland will monitor all the Climate policies and that appropriate measures are undertaken accordingly. The Environment Agency will, furthermore, provide guidance on how to calculate GHG emissions from operations and the results of certain measures.
Government organisations and government majority owned companies have the possibility to sign up for the project „Green steps in government operations“ and a similar project is currently being developed for municipalities. Participants in the project publish „Green accounting“ which will be updated and expanded to include GHG emissions, with a focus on internal operations.

Ireland,33,Deep Retrofit Pilot (With Existing Measures),"Deep retrofit is the significant upgrade of a building toward nearly zero energy requirements where the whole home is viewed as a system with respect to its energy performance.  The core principle of the Deep Retrofit Pilot Programme is fabric first- maximising insulation to minimise energy demand. A highly efficient heating system will further reduce the energy consumed to meet the reduced energy demand. Mechanical ventilation is also required in order to ensure good indoor air quality. Deep Retrofit Pilot Programme requires that all homes funded through the Deep Retrofit Pilot Programme must achieve a minimum Building Energy Rating (BER) of A3 with an uplift in the BER of a minimum of 150 kWh/m2/yr. Airtightness of no more than 5 m3/hr/m2 must be achieved, hence the requirement for mechanical ventilation.

It has been several times extended and amended until 2010. For the 2011-2016 period, the voluntary agreement aimed to improve energy efficiency by a general objective of 7 % (i.e. 1 % per year). The average for 2009 and 2010 was used as a reference. The development of energy efficiency is measured using a general efficiency characteristic value, which corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the company-specific efficiency characteristics. If the general objective is not met and the company-specific improvement is below the 7 % target, the relevant participating enterprises must pay a proportion of the tax on the purchasing of electricity and gas, from which they are otherwise exempt. In addition to improving their energy efficiency, the participating industrial companies undertook to introduce an energy management system, by identifying the potential for improvement and drawing up an action plan to implement at least some of this potential. Enterprises that fail to meet their obligations – including annual reporting requirements – may be excluded from the agreement.
The latest voluntary agreement was running from 1 March 2017 up to 31 December 2020. In this latest agreement, training in energy efficiency management requirements has been included, as well as an exchange of good practices between participating companies. The general objective of 7 % over the period was however maintained. The average for 2014 and 2015 was used as a reference. The participating enterprises were required to finance the energy efficiency improvements themselves. In return, they were exempted from a proportion of the tax on electricity and gas.

Netherlands,1,"Energy tax, incl. sustainable energy surcharge (ODE)","Energy taxation scheme, introduced in 1996 as Regulatory Energy Tax (REB) and since 2004, after various changes, known as Energy Tax (EB). The objective of this policy is to boost energy savings by putting an incentive on reducing the consumption of gas and electricity, which should direct consumers toward more energy efficient behaviour. More recent CO2 reduction became more important, resulting e.g. in tariff shifts from electricity to gas. The energy tax is levied a.o. on electricity and natural gas, and the level depends on the level of energy consumption of a customer (degressive tariff structure). There are some exemptions and refund options (under conditions) e.g. for companies that participate in Long Term Agreements on energy efficiency. In 2013 a surcharge system (ODE) was introduced in order to cover expenditures resulting from the sustainable energy production scheme. Also this system differentiates between levels of energy use and between type of users (e.g. companies or dwellings).

Percentages vary over the years. Yearly a list is published with applicable technologies and criteria. Proposals can be submitted for techniques to be considered for, and if approved, included on the energy list. The equipment must save more energy than the prevailing equipment available on the market. This means that only the latest types of equipment are eligible for the EIA. Also a general EIA application can be submitted, using an energy-saving calculation to demonstrate that equipment that is not on the energy list meets EIA criteria. Since 2013/2014 as result of the Energy Agreement, the EIA focuses mainly on energy-saving technologies (for renewable energy options, companies are referred to other policies and measures).

A total of over €12 million for the associations (in dutch VvE) and some €84 million for owner-occupants were made available as a subsidy for energy saving measures by the end of 2020. The subsidy, which comprises approximately 20% of the investment, will only be issued when at least two of the following energy saving measures are performed, under the conditions set out in the subsidy scheme: wall insulation, cavity wall insulation, roof insulation, floor or ground insulation and replacing windows with low-emissivity glass. When at least two energy saving measures are implemented under this requirement, the owner-occupier or owners’ association can also receive an additional subsidy for further energy saving measures, such as insulating doors or customised. The measures and associated requirements largely correspond to the measures and requirements for the National Energy-saving Fund (NEF)) This means that the subsidy and loan can be combined to cover the entire investment. The scheme for owner-occupants has ended by the end of 2020, for home-owner associations the scheme is intended upto 2022. Late 2020 the budget for both owner-occupants as well as homeowners’ associations was exceeded by a large number of applications.

CO2 emission figures for each type of vehicle are listed in the register kept by the vehicle registration authority (RDW Rijksdienst voor het wegverkeer). In addition, when a vehicle is registered on name of an owner, the owner has to pay motor vehicle tax (MRB). The height of this tax depends on e.g. the type of vehicle, weight, fuel, environmental characteristics and region. It is intended that upto 2024 no MRB has to paid for full electric cars and in 2025 a 75% reduced rate applies. For PHEV's a 50% reduced rate applies up until 2025.

Norway,27,CO2 compensation scheme,"The object of the CO2 compensation scheme is to prevent carbon leakage resulting from increased electricity prices due to the EU ETS. The scheme includes all 15 sectors listed in the EU.

In 2013, Norway established a CO2 compensation scheme for the manufacturing industry. The purpose of the scheme is to prevent carbon leakage resulting from increased electricity prices due to the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), and affected companies can apply for such compensation to the Norwegian Environmental Agency. Norway is part of the integrated Nordic electricity market and there are electricity cables linking our system to both Germany and the Netherlands. 

Hence, increased electricity prices in Europe, due to the EU ETS, result in increased electricity prices in Norway as well. The result is a competitive disadvantage for the electricity intensive manufacturing industry  Norway, compared with businesses outside of Europe. The CO2 compensation scheme is intended to partly counteract this disadvantage.

The compensation scheme is based on the EFTA Surveillance Authority’s (ESA) state aid guidelines. The scheme is governed by the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment, and administered by the Norwegian Environment Agency.",National,Single,527,Single PaM,Economic,Implemented,ESD/ESR; EU ETS,Other Sectors,Industrial Processes: Other industrial processes,,CO2; N2O; PFC,,,,,National government,National government: Ministry of Climate and Environment/Norwegian Environment Agency,2013,,No,No information,No information,With existing measures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Norways%20Fourth%20Biennial%20Report%20FINAL.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Envi-ronmentally hazardous activities, as defined in the 9th chapter, require obtain-ing a permit. The permit application must include an environmental impact assessment as described in the 6th chapter. In 2018 changes were made in the 6th chapter in order to clarify that direct, indirect and cumulative impacts should be included in the environmental impact assessment. Greenhouse gas emissions form part of the permit assessment procedure and the Code also includes requirements to use the best available technology. However, effec-tive 2005, issuing permits including emissions limit values for carbon dioxide or limiting the use of fossil fuels for installations covered by the EU Emis-sions Trading Scheme is no longer permitted.

Sweden,5,Research and Development,"Public investment in climate-related research and development are aimed at creating better prerequisites for achieving the substantial longer-term emis-sions reduction required. Swedish climate-related research covers a broad spectrum, from natural sciences to humanities, but with an emphasis on tech-nical and scientific research and development. Three important research areas are energy, transport and industry, for which the Government has decided to grant extensive funding.  Energy and climate issues are closely linked, and the solutions to the challenge of climate change are largely energy-related. The overall objective of energy research and innovation in Sweden is to contribute to fulfilling the national energy and climate objectives, the long-term energy and climate policy, and energy-related environmental objectives.  
 
In the budget bill for 2017 , which has been approved by the Swedish Par-liament, the government proposed an expansion of contributions to energy research and development with funding of SEK 620 million for 2017–2020. This resulted in a level of SEK 1.6 billion in 2020, compared with the earlier level of SEK 1.3 billion.  The Government's budget bill for 2021 allocates SEK 1.57 billion for operations in 2021.

Sweden,9,Carbon dioxide tax,"A carbon dioxide tax, based on the fossil carbon content in the fuel, was in-troduced in 1991 and aims at reducing the emissions of carbon dioxide in sectors outside the EU ETS. The tax has been raised in several steps since it was first implemented. In total, the tax has increased from SEK 0.25/kg (1991) carbon dioxide to SEK 1.20/kg (2021). In addition to specific tax increases stipulated in Government bills, a yearly indexation of the tax level is applied.  

The tax level is proportionate to the calculated amount of carbon dioxide emissions, based on the fuel’s fossil carbon content. This means that biofuels currently are not subject to carbon taxation, if not used within the reduction obligation scheme for motor fuels. With regard to motor fuels, changes to carbon taxation of biofuels were implemented on 1st July 2018 (see separate section on carbon and energy taxation in the transport sector). 

Due to the risk of carbon leakage, a reduced carbon tax is applied for diesel used in agriculture, forestry and aquaculture.

Electricity suppliers are obliged by law to submit electricity certificates corresponding to a certain share, or quota, of their electricity deliveries. The quota is gradually being increased yearly up to 2020 and 2030. Electricity producers are allocated a certificate from the central government for every megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable electricity produced. The producers are allowed to sell the certificates in an open market where the price is set by the seller and buyer. The certificates thereby provide extra profit for the producers of renewable electricity (SFS 2011:1200). 

The rapid development with regard to the expansion of renewable electricity production has led to the electricity certificate system now fulfills a limited function.

Sweden,14,Initiatives for wind power,"Research programs 
Different programs have promoted the dissemination of knowledge and in-formation about wind power. One example is the research program “Vindval”, which aims to collect and provide scientific knowledge about wind power’s impacts on humans and on nature .  
 
Designation of areas of national interest for wind power 
Since 2004, certain land and water areas in Sweden have been designated as areas of national interest for wind power. There are 313 such areas in Sweden, of which 284 are located onshore and 29 offshore. The most recent update was carried out in 2013 and four areas were added in 2015. The total area of these national interests for wind power is roughly 8,000 km2, representing about 1.5 % of the country’s land area, including Swedish waters.   
 
A national strategy for sustainable wind power expansion 
The Swedish Energy agency and the Swedish Environmen-tal protection agency have jointly developed a national strategy for sustainable wind power expansion, which was presented in January 2021. The strategy, which only covers land-based wind power, contains a regional distribution of a national development need and a national planning basis.

The investment support contributes to an increased electricity production from solar power systems and to business development of solar energy technology. The support ended 31 December 2020 and has for private individuals been replaced by a tax deduction for green investments. Municipalities and companies will be eligible to continued support in 2021 for the installation of solar cells and energy storage.

Sweden,21,Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) and Energy Labelling Regulation 2017/1369/EU  ,"Energy labelling is mandatory for the product groups that are regulated by the Energy Labelling Directive (2010/30/EU) and applies to all EU member states. Energy labeling makes the product's energy use visible and facilitates for consumers who want to make energy smart choices.  
 
The Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) aims to improve the products’ environmental performance during their full life cycle. The requirements act as a floor to prohibit and remove the very worst products on the market, seen from an energy perspective. In principle, these rules can be applied to all energy-related products (except transport) and cover all energy sources. Sweden is particularly active in market surveillance activities, involving laboratory tests of products as well as supervision of distributors. The directive has been implemented in Sweden through the Ecodesign Act (SFS 2008:112).

Under these regulations, new passenger cars should not emit an average of more than 130 g CO2/km by 2015 and not more than 95 g CO2/km by 2021. New vans should not emit an average of more than 175 g CO2/km by 2017 and 147 g CO2/km by 2020. New standards for 2025 and 2030 were adopted by the EU during 2019. Accordingly, CO2-emissions from new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles are to be reduced by 37.5 percent and 31 percent respectively by 2030 compared to average emissions 2021. In 2019 the EU also adopted CO2-emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles.

Sweden,34,Differentiated vehicle tax,"Since 2006, Sweden has differentiated the annual vehicle tax with respect to the vehicle’s carbon dioxide emissions per kilometer. For older vehicles the tax is dependent on weight. The CO2-related vehicle tax is SEK?22 per g?CO2/km beyond 111?g?CO2/km in mixed driving. This CO2 component is multiplied by a factor of 2.37 for diesel cars, since diesel fuel has a lower energy tax than petrol. Cars adapted for alternative fuels such as ethanol and gas, except LPG, are taxed at a lower rate of SEK?11 per g?CO2/km beyond the first 111 g?CO2/km. Light trucks, light buses and campers were also brought into the system of CO2-differentiated vehicle taxation as of 2011. The taxation of older cars and heavy trucks is mainly based on weight. The main purpose of the differentiation is to make car buyers chose cars with a low climate im-pact.  

The system applies to cars sold before the bonus malus system was introduced on 1 July 2018, and will also apply again for cars “leaving” the bonus malus system three years after purchase. Light diesel vehicles will keep the fuel sur-charge from the bonus malus system instead of the fuel factor of 2.37.

Sweden,38,Lower benefit value on cars with advanced environmental technology,"Company-registered cars represent about 50 % of new car registrations in Sweden. Approximately 50 % of these cars are cars that are registered in the name of a company and made available to employees for private use. The benefits of private use of a company car are subject to personal income taxes. The value of the benefit corresponds on average to the market value of the cost of owning the car.  
Fuel provided by the employer is taxed separately. The value of the benefit corresponds to 1.2 times the market value of the cost of fuel. Hence, employ-ees have an incentive to choose more fuel-efficient cars and to limit the pri-vate use of company cars.  
 
To increase the incentive to purchase company cars that use environmental technologies, green cars receive relatively favorable tax treatment through the reduction of their benefit value. Typically, the benefit value is reduced to the (lower) level of a similar model without the environmental technology of the green car. This reduction is permanent.  
 
In addition to this reduction, the benefit value of electric cars, plug-in hybrids and cars powered by natural gas (other than liquefied petroleum gas) were provided an extra reduction of 40 %, up to a maximum of SEK 16,000 annually, until the end of 2016. As of 2017, and until the end of 2020, this additional reduction has been lowered to SEK 10,000. 
 
The Government proposes in its budget bill for 2021 adjustments to the car benefit to better reflect the market value, which means that the taxation of most fossil-fueled benefit cars would increase.

Sweden,43,"Carbon dioxide tax and energy tax in agriculture, forestry and aquaculture sectors  ","Up until 2014 the agriculture, forestry and aquaculture sectors paid 30% of the general energy and carbon dioxide tax rates for fossil fuel used for heating purposes. Since then, the carbon dioxide tax reduction in the sectors has been reduced in steps. The carbon dioxide tax in these sectors was increased to 60% of the standard rate in January 2015 and to 80% in January 2016, and the carbon dioxide reduction was then totally rescinded on 1st January 2018. The energy tax paid is still 30 % of the general energy tax rate for heat-ing fuels in these sectors. The Government proposed in its budget bill for 2021  to totally rescind the reduction of energy tax on heating fuels for agriculture, forestry and aquaculture in two steps. It is still a proposal and not yet decided by the Swedish Riksdag.  

A special reimbursement for carbon tax on diesel for machinery in agricultural, forestry and aquaculture activities was lowered gradually from SEK 2.10 per liter (2011) to SEK 0.90 per liter in 2015. However, in 2016, the repayment was increased to SEK 1.70 per liter for the period until the end of 2018, when it was again lowered to SEK 1.43 per liter. On 1st July 2019, the reimbursement was raised again to SEK 2.24 per liter and was also subject to a tax reduction on the energy tax by SEK 0.19 per liter. From the 1 st of January 2020 the reimbursement for carbon tax on die-sel for machinery in agricultural , forestry and aquaculture activities was SEK 1.93 per liter.

Sweden,44,Forest Policy and the Forest Act,"The Swedish Forest  Policy (as of 1993) has two overarching, equal objectives: the production objective and the environment objective. 

Under the Forest Policy  , there are no production subsidies  , and forest owners have considerable freedom and responsibility to independently conduct long-term sustainable forest management. The regulations in the Forestry Act concerning timber production cover the notification of felling, the lowest age for felling, requirements for reforestation, guidelines for thinning and measures to limit damage. Special regulations apply to certain types of forests, such as subalpine forests and deciduous forests. Examples of regulations concerning nature conservation and cultural heritage include not disturbing important biotopes, buffer zones and arable land, and leaving older trees, high stumps and dead wood in situ. Sustainable forest management influences carbon dioxide removals and emissions in various ways, through the production of renewable raw materials that can replace fossil fuels and materials that generate emissions of greenhouse gases while maintaining or increasing carbon stocks in biomass, soils and harvested wood products.

Sweden,45,Regulation on land drainage  ,"The Swedish Environmental Code chapter 11 contains regulations on land drainage, which can be used to reduce emissions from peat soils with large carbon stocks. Land drainage measures are actions taken to remove water from soil or protect against water. In order for the measure to be a land drain-age measure according to the Environmental Code, the purpose of the measure is to permanently increase the soil's suitability for a specific purpose, such as cultivation, development, peat cover, road construction, garden plant or golf courses.  
 
In central parts of the southern Swedish highlands and north of the limes norrlandicus (the biogeographical boundary of northern Sweden), drainage may only be undertaken with a permit. In the rest of the country, and on sites specially protected under the RAMSAR Convention, such schemes are prohibited.

These measures in the form of nature reserves, nature conservation agreements, are also positive for carbon stocks in forest biomass and soil carbon by allowing them to be maintained or continue to increase. 
 
Nature reserves  
In Sweden, nature reserves  are one of the most common ways of protecting valuable nature in the long term. At present, there are close to 5000 nature reserves in Sweden. The seventh chapter of the Environmental Code contains the regulations for the establishment of nature reserves. The work of establish-ing nature reserves is led by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. 
 
Nature conservation agreements  
Nature conservation agreement is a civil law agreement . The property owner and the state or a municipality agree on a certain financial compensation for the property owner, for example, to refrain from logging. The Swedish Forest Agency and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency cooperate in their implementation.

Sweden,60,Support for biogas production,"In January 2015, the Government introduced a support scheme for biogas production through anaerobic digestion of manure. The support aims to in-crease biogas production from manure and thereby gain two-fold environmen-tal and climate benefits through reduced methane emissions from manure and the substitution of fossil energy.  The increased digestion of manure offers several environmental benefits. It reduces both emissions of greenhouse gases and eutrophication of fresh and marine waters, as well as produces biogas for energy. The biogas generated can be used to generate electricity or heat, or as vehicle fuel. The subsidy amounts to a maximum of 0.40 SEK/kWh of biogas produced. In the latest support period, 1 October 2019 un-til 30 September 2020, a total amount of SEK 29,9 million was shared among 65xx biogas plants generating 178 GWh.

Sweden,69,Industrial Leap,"The Industrial Leap is a long-term reform which began in 2018 and continues until 2040. It consists of a government scheme that aims to support develop-ment of technology and processes to reduce the process-related greenhouse gas emissions in Swedish industry. Financial support, administered by the Swedish Energy Agency, may be provided for research, feasibility studies, pilot and demonstration projects as well as full-scale investments. Projects related to mitigation, as well as to negative emissions, are eligible for funding. The target group for support is industries with process-related emissions, along with universities and research institutes.  
 
The scope of the Industrial Leap was amended 2020 when support for measures leading to negative emissions such as BECCS (Bio-Energy with Car-bon Capture and Storage) was added.  
 
In 2018, the government budgeted SEK 300 million for the program, while in 2019 the budget was increased to SEK 500 million followed by another in-crease in June 2020 to SEK 600 million for the period 2020-2022.  
 
In December 2020 the Government decided to further extend the purpose of the grant to also be able to finance research, feasibility studies and invest-ments relating to other greenhouse gas emissions, such as certain combustion emissions and diffuse emissions, linked to process-related emissions and stra-tegically important initiatives in industry that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Further, the grant was increased by SEK 150 million in 2021 and is expected to increase by SEK 100 million in 2022.

Sweden,71,Emission reduction obligation,"In July 2018, a greenhouse gas emission reduction obligation for petrol and diesel in conjunction with fuel tax reforms, called the Fuel Change, was im-plemented. The emission reduction obligation establishes an obligation on petrol and diesel suppliers to reduce life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions, by gradually increasing blending with sustainable biofuels. The Fuel Change Reduction obligation scheme makes an important contribution to the phasing out of fossil fuels in road transport. The obligation replaces the former tax exemption for low-blended biofuels, i.e. biofuels covered by the scheme will be subject to the same tax rate per liter as fossil equivalents. At the same time, both the carbon dioxide and energy tax rates for fuels covered by the Fuel ChangeReduction obligation scheme have been reduced. The ad-justment of the carbon tax rate was implemented to reflect the reduced green-house gas emissions that the blend-in of sustainable biofuels entails. The en-ergy tax rate was reduced to maintain a stable price-level for fuels, so that consumers would be largely unaffected by the reform. High-blended biofuels are not covered by the scheme and are, if sustainable, completely exempt from both carbon dioxide and energy tax.

The Government proposed in its Budget Bill for 2021 that the reduction levels within the reduction obligation scheme be increased gradually until 2030 with indicative levels of 28 per cent for petrol and 66 per cent for diesel 2030 and a control station 2022.

Sweden,72,Bonus-Malus system,"A bonus malus system for the purchase of new light vehicles, was implement-ed in July 2018. Vehicles with low emissions of carbon dioxide qualify for a bonus at purchase, while vehicles with high emissions of carbon dioxide will be taxed at a higher rate for the first three years. The system covers purchases of new light passenger cars, light buses and light trucks. The aim of the system is to increase the proportion of environmentally friendly vehicles and contrib-ute to achieving the goal of a fossil-free vehicle fleet. 
 
Maximum bonus is given to vehicles with zero emissions from the exhaust pipe - SEK 60,000. The bonus then decreases by SEK 714 per gram of carbon dioxide per kilometer emitted. At 70 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer, the bonus ends. Biogas cars receive a fixed bonus amount of SEK 10,000 regardless of the size of their carbon dioxide emissions. In the emission range of 70-95 grams per kilometer there is neither bonus, nor malus.  
 
All cars are subject to at least SEK 360 per year in vehicle taxes regardless of emissions. Light petrol or diesel vehicles with high emissions of carbon diox-ide are subject to an increase in vehicle tax (malus) during the first three years. Ethanol and gas-powered vehicles are exempted from the increased tax. The vehicle tax for diesel-powered light vehicles in the bonus–malus-system is adjusted by converting the current fuel factor into a fuel surcharge. When the cars reach three years, the extra tax disappears and all but light diesel vehicles are taxed as in the differentiated vehicle tax system. 
 
The Government proposed in its Budget Bill for 2021, which was adopted by the Riksdag in December 2020, the climate bonus for zero-emission vehicles should be increased from SEK 60,000 to SEK 70,000. In addition, the limit for bonuses should be lowered from 70 to 60 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer and the maximum bonus amount for vehicles with emissions above zero should amount to around SEK 45,000. In order to strengthen the envi-ronmental management and financing of the system, malus should also be raised. This should be done by increasing the amounts included in the in-creased carbon dioxide amount by SEK 25 per gram of carbon dioxide. For the same reason, the lower limit for when the increased amount of carbon dioxide is taken out should be lowered from 95 to 90 grams and the limit for when the higher level is taken out should be lowered from 140 to 130 grams per kilometer.
