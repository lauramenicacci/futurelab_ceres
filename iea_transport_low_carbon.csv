Draft Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy 2018,https://www.iea.org/policies/2867-draft-delhi-electric-vehicle-policy-2018,"In 2013, Government of India launched a National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020. Under the mission plan, the Scheme for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid&) Electric Vehicles in India (‘FAME India’) was launched in March, 2015 for two years as Phase-I, which has subsequently been extended up to 31 March, 2019. Several states have also announced an EV policy (e.g., Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh) to complement national policy and address state specific needs.Despite Central and State government incentives, pure electric vehicle penetration currently (i.e., in 2017) remains quite low in India, about 0.1% for cars, ~0.2% for 2 wheelers and practically nil for commercial vehicles. This is largely driven by following critical hurdles: a) high upfront purchase price of EVs, b) almost non-existent public charging infrastructure, c) lack of products comparable to ICE vehicles (especially in the 2 wheeler category) and d) low levels of investment in EV manufacturing capacity.The Draft Delhi EV Policy 2018, to be notified by the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (‘GNCTD’) and which will remain valid for five years from the date of notification, recognises that a new approach is required to kick-start EV adoption in Delhi. It will therefore seek to put in place measures that address the key hurdles to EV adoption. The GNCTD will also develop a communication plan focused on driving awareness regarding the benefits of adopting electric vehicles and the key elements of this policy.This policy will apply exclusively to Battery Electric Vehicles (as defined in Annexure -1, FAME India). Mild Hybrid, Strong Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles will not be targeted by this policy. ‘FAME India’ in this policy refers to the Scheme for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India as notified on 13th March, 2015 by the Govt. of India and any subsequent amendments thereof.Objectives include:• The primary objective of the Delhi EV Policy 2018 is to bring about a material improvement in Delhi’s air quality by bringing down emissions from transport sector. To do so, this policy will seek to drive rapid adoption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in a manner where they contribute to 25% of all new vehicle registrations by 2023.• This policy will also seek to put in place measures to support the creation of jobs in driving, selling, financing, servicing and charging of EVs.",Undefined,12 May 2021,http://transport.delhi.gov.in/sites/default/files/All-PDF/Electric%20Policy%202018.pdf,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Taxes, fees and charges|Congestion charge|Use and activity charges",Transport|Road transport,Drive train or engine|Battery electric|Hybrid|Plug-in hybrid|Transport technologies,Undefined,India,2018,In force,National,IND

Priority is to be given to purchasing ZEVs.• Starting in the 2018 to 2019 fiscal year, all new executive vehicle purchases will be ZEVs or hybrids.• Fleet management will be optimized including by applying telematics to collect and analyse vehicle usage data on vehicles scheduled to be replaced.In 2018, the Federal Government worked with subnational governments to develop and release a “Best Practice Guide for Greening Government Fleets”, which identifies a clear process for governments at all levels to implement to reduce emissions from their vehicle fleets. This process includes logging fleet vehicle use, driving pattern, driving behaviour and fuel consumption, to determine the lowest emitting option to meet operational needs, including through the deployment of greater numbers of ZEV.

These annual percentage targets are not for NEV sales, but for NEV credits. Each NEV is assigned a specific number of credits depending on metrics including electric range, energy efficiency, and rated power of fuel cell systems. Higher performance vehicles get more credits, capped at six credits per vehicle. These NEV credit targets thus may result in NEV market share falling into a range of values based on fleet mix. Assuming that all manufacturers produce vehicles with a per-vehicle NEV credit of three in 2020, for example, the market share of NEVs in China based on number of vehicles sold would be around 4% in 2020 while still meeting the 12% target based on NEV credits.",Undefined,5 December 2019,http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146295/n1652858/n7280902/c5824932/content.html,Energy Efficiency|Electrification,Regulation,Transport|Road transport|Passenger transport (Road),"Road vehicles|Large cars, SUVs, passenger / pickup trucks and light duty vehicles|Drive train or engine|Battery electric|Plug-in hybrid|Transport technologies|Vehicle type",Undefined,People's Republic Of China,2018,Ended,National,CHN

Given the difficulties that still exist with regard to the market penetration of this type of vehicles, it is necessary to continue providing aid for their purchase by regulating the granting of direct subsidies. For this purpose, the aid programme for the purchase of alternative-energy vehicles was approved: the MOVALT Vehicles Plan. The initial funding for this programme was a maximum budget of €20 million, with a limit of €600,000 for electric motorbikes (L3e, L4e, L5e).

National Biofuels Policy,https://www.iea.org/policies/2475-national-biofuels-policy,"In December, 2017, a new National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio) was signed into law (Federal Law Nº 13.576).  The Policy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the life cycle energy efficiency of biofuels, and promote the national biofuel industry.  It calls for establishment of national carbon intensity targets, to be allocated among fuel distributors in proportion to their market share. Non-compliance can result in penalties between R$ 100 000  and R$ 50 000 000. The law further creates the framework for establishing decarbonisation credits (Crédito de Descarbonização - CBIO) for tracking and compliance with carbon emissions targets, as well as certificates reflecting the energy efficiency and carbon intensity of biofuels. In practice, RenovaBio is designed to introduce market mechanisms to recognize the capacity of each biofuel to reduce emissions individually per production unit. Basically, there are two main instruments: 1) Establishment of national fuel matrix emission reduction targets, set for a period of 10 years. The goals are important to bring predictability, in terms of volumetric fuel needs (fossil and renewable) in this time horizon, and thus allow private agents to make their planning and investment analysis in a less uncertain environment. National targets will be broken down into individual annual mandatory targets for all fuel distributors, according to their participation in the fossil fuel market; 2) Certification of biofuels production by private inspector firms, giving different grades for each producing unit (higher will be the grade for the producer that produces the largest amount of net energy, with lower CO2e emissions, in the life cycle). The note will accurately reflect each producer agent's individual contribution to mitigating a specific amount of greenhouse gases relative to their fossil substitute (in terms of tons of CO2e). The certification process of biofuel production under RenovaBio will be under the responsibility of the ANP. These two instruments will be linked with the creation of the Biofuel Decarbonization Credit (CBIO). It will be a financial asset, traded on the stock exchange, issued by the biofuel producer, from the commercialization of its production (after issuing the invoice). Fuel distributors will meet the target by demonstrating the required amount of CBIOs on their property. Other agents (individuals and companies) may buy and sell CBIOs on the stock exchange, as a way to bring greater liquidity to this market.",Undefined,14 October 2019,http://www.mme.gov.br/web/guest/secretarias/petroleo-gas-natural-e-combustiveis-renovaveis/programas/renovabio/principal,Energy Efficiency,"Regulation|Renewable / Non-fossil energy obligations|Payments, finance and taxation|Performance-based policies|Obligations on average types of sales / output",Transport,Transport technologies,Undefined,Brazil,2017,In force,National,BRA

Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy,https://www.iea.org/policies/2032-public-sector-energy-efficiency-strategy,"In 2009, when Government first set the national energy efficiency target of 20% by 2020, it decided that the public sector should provide leadership on energy efficiency for the whole of our economy and society.   This is why the public service was assigned a more challenging target of 33% energy efficiency improvement.   The policy context for this is outlined in Chapter 2 of the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy. The Strategy sets out a clear policy direction for public sector action on climate action through energy efficiency and sustainable energy management whilst contributing to public sector reform.   Outlined in the Strategy are new actions to complement the existing suite of support and regulatory measures for public sector energy efficiency already in place since 2009.   The Strategy identifies where most potential exists for further energy efficiency gains across the public sector in areas such as the built environment, public lighting, transport and water services (Chapter 3).   It also outlines the technical guidance, financial supports and governance structures which will assist public sector bodies to further understand their energy use, identify cost effective energy efficiency projects and develop robust project business cases to allow the establishment of a strong project pipeline and coordinated government decision making on investment. To assist public bodies and provide oversight of the implementation of the Strategy, a Steering Group will be established chaired by DCCAE and consisting of officials from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community & Local Government (DHPCLG), Department of Transport, Tourism & Sport (DTTAS), the OPW, the SEAI and the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). The Strategy recognises that simply identifying actions is not enough. Taking action requires leadership and accountability from senior managers akin to what is already required in areas such as performance management and governance. That is the rationale for the establishment of a new Governance structure (Chapter 4). While each public body must take responsibility for managing its own energy, its parent Department will have an oversight and leadership role for ensuring that the bodies under their aegis, i.e. their  ""group"", engage in structured energy management. This will have a number of advantages:  Creating accountability, as Departments will have to report to government annually;  Forming a coherent view of energy saving potential across all 350 public bodies;  Allowing more flexibility in strategic decisions to be made on where best to concentrate effort within a Department  'group ' -not all bodies will be able to make 33% energy savings, but some will be able to do better than 33%. As part of the governance structure, each public sector body is required to designate a senior manager (anticipated to be Assistant Secretary level in Government departments) with decision making powers on finance, personnel and facilities, as Energy Performance Officers (EPO 's). Each body EPO will be responsible for providing leadership on structured energy management in their respective organisation. In addition, EPO in government departments will provide oversight of progress by the bodies in their  'group ', and report to Government on strategic challenges faced, and progress made.",Undefined,14 September 2020,https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/energy/topics/Energy-Efficiency/public-sector/Pages/Public-Sector-Energy-Efficiency-Strategy.aspx,Energy Efficiency,"Strategic plans|Targets, plans and framework legislation",Buildings|Services|Transport,Transport technologies,Undefined,Ireland,2017,In force,National,IRL

Charge Points Installed by ESB E-Cars,https://www.iea.org/policies/6667-charge-points-installed-by-esb-e-cars,"There are 3 types of charge points being installed by ESB ecars nationwide: home charge points, public charge points and fast charge points.Home charge pointsA home charge point is usually installed on an external wall of the house and electric car charging is facilitated through domestic electricity supply. An electric car will draw single phase 16A (3.6kW) when connected to the home charge point. A full charge from 0% will take between 6 and 8 hours. If the car is plugged in overnight it will be fully charged by the next morning. Some electricity suppliers offer discounted electricity tariffs for night time usage of electricity so electric car charging is most efficient at this time. ESB ecars is installing home charge points free of charge for the first 2,000 electric car owners. For more information follow the steps to buying an electric car and register for a free home charge point.Public charge pointsPublic charge points are being installed on-street and in locations such as shopping centres and car parks. They are connected to a local 3-phase electricity supply and depending on the car type and battery size, charging takes between 1 and 6 hours. Public charge points are accessed in a secure manner using a special RFID charge point card which is obtained when registering for electric car charging. To see the public charge point installations see our charge point map.Charge Point StandardsIreland has decided to standardise home and public charge points with Mode 3 charging using an IEC Type 2 socket, (commonly referred to as a ‘Mennekes socket’) which is a 7 pin socket. This was as a result of extensive consultation and research with input from car manufacturers about the next generation of electric cars. This Mode 3 charging has additional safety features and communication aspects and will eventually be deployed in all European countries. It is accepted internationally as the safest method of charging. The ‘Mennekes socket’ charge point is compatible with Nissan, Renault, Peugeot, and Mitsubishi electric cars and the next generation of electric cars. This electric car charge point infrastructure is now being rolled out across Ireland.Fast charge pointsFast charge points can deliver higher power to electric cars resulting in a much shorter charging time than domestic charging. Fast charge points are installed mainly along inter-urban routes to facilitate nationwide electric car travel. Fast charging can be done using 3-phase, 63A AC (44kW) or 120A, 400V DC (50kW). A 50kW DC fast charge point can charge a suitable electric car up to 80% in 20-30 minutes. The Nissan Leaf, Mitsubishi iMiEV, Peugeot iOn and Citroen C-ZERO support DC fast charging. Fast charge points are designed to “power up” electric cars at a faster rate. They deliver up to 50 kW of direct current via a special connector developed by the CHAdeMO Association.",Undefined,5 November 2017,https://www.irishevowners.ie/charge-points/,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Payments and transfers|Grants",Transport|Road transport,Road vehicles|Drive train or engine|Battery electric|Plug-in hybrid|Transport technologies|Battery technologies|Electric charging infrastructure|Private chargers,Undefined,Ireland,2016,In force,National,IRL

The aspirational target is that by 2020 10% of newly-sold passenger vehicles should have an electric powertrain. In addition, 75,000 private individuals should be driving an electric car by 2020, with 50,000 of these being second-hand and 25,000 new vehicles. By 2025, the aim is for 50 % of all newly-sold cars to have an electric powertrain. A minimum of 30 % of these, i.e. 15 % of all newly-sold cars, must be Battery Electric Vehicles. To achieve these high-level targets, the strategy includes the following goals: 1. Improving and expanding the charging infrastructure for EVs. This mainly involves: the realisation of a sound business case - in cooperation with The Netherlands Knowledge Platform for Public Charging Infrastructure (NKL); making the most of the Funding Green Deal public charging infrastructure and for monitoring progress; formulating a shared vision about the future of the smart charging infrastructure, by managing the balancing and/or congestion of the grid, using electric cars for energy storage. 2. Improving the storage capacity of electric vehicles in relation to the variable use of renewable energy and grid stability. Upscaling of experimentation and research through the Smart Charging Living Lab. 3. Developing the consumer market. 4. Creating scope for leaders in the area of EV, and exploiting the international revenue potential. 5. Supporting innovation through working groups from the Light Electric Vehicles (LEV) market segments, as an alternative to short car trips, PHEVs (implementation of the action plan) and Heavy Wheels (Research & Development). The Parties recognise that a ‘disruptive innovation’ benefits from the existence of leaders who can accelerate the transition and can drive change. A regulatory framework and special funding arrangements are needed to create scope for this. 6. Creating broad and robust support for EV by means of a charm offensive. 7.

This measure, defined in the Energy Savings and Efficiency Activation Plan implemented by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism through the IDAE (Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving), consists of establishing an energy efficiency valuation mechanism applied to public transport systems, which makes it possible to uniformly evaluate the progress made, and take it into account in distributing this aid. In this regard, 5% of the subsidy will be allocated based on the score obtained for compliance with environmental criteria.In this context, the IDAE defined certain efficiency criteria and minimum compliance ratios to obtain a score, looking ahead to a possible final assessment which varied according to city size. Generally speaking, the new allocation scheme for subsidies is based on compliance with certain ratios and conditions established for a set of efficiency criteria identified as necessary to classify the provision of the public transport service from the perspective of energy efficiency. Municipalities, under a competitive scheme and according to the final score obtained based on the compliance ratios for efficiency and environmental criteria, divide up part of the money from the distribution fund (5% of the total budget).This measure was approved in the general budget for financial year 2013 (Act 17/2012, of 27 December, on the General State Budget for financial year 2013.

The coal power plants with the capacity of over 600 MW are required to achieve the efficiency target of 300g of coal equivalent/kWh by 2020.2. Building: The implementation of a higher national building energy efficiency standard will be accelerated, requiring a combined 75% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the building standards of the early 1980s. It is expected that in 2020, the green buildings will account for at least 50% of new buildings in the urban region. The heat market will undertake a transition to a consumption-based billing system in an accelerated pace.3. Industry: The expansion of high-pollution and high energy-intensive industries is heavily restricted, alongside the phase-out of obsolete technologies and excess capacity. The focus is on coal-red industrial boiler (kiln) retro; district cogeneration and waste heat and pressure utilisation.4.

According to some estimates, 10 % of energy use in the transport sector originates from construction, maintenance, and operation of infrastructure. Measures include the choice and production of materials, and methods of construction. It also involves design and choices of speed limits. With a long-term perspective, the Swedish Transport Administration assumes it can influence the energy consumption of future transport systems at the planning, design or construction stage.The Transport Administration has introduced energy efficiency as a focal area in its activities. The purpose is to find new measures for energy efficiency in investment projects which can be assumed to be disseminated. All subcontractors are encouraged to suggest more energy efficient methods for building roads and railways.For several years, the Transport Administration has worked with a lighting strategy by switching off unnecessary lighting, introducing more energy efficient equipment, and by removing lighting from roads to bicycle and pedestrian paths.Moreover, the operation and maintenance of infrastructure requires considerable amounts of energy, in the form of both fuel and electricity. The Swedish Transport Administration also develops energy procurement requirements and follow-ups on contractors and fuel use in various operational areas. Lighting and tunnel fans will be placed optimally and be fitted with timers. Climate-conscious road traffic management can also make a contribution. Service and maintenance must also be optimized to reduce the amount of energy consumed by transport and business.In addition to these measures, eco-driving has been introduced on road ferries (e.g. cable ferries where appropriate), while energy efficiency is highlighted on airport services and harbors, e.g. lighthouses have been equipped with energy efficient lamps.In rail transportation there is also significant scope for improvement. The Transport Administration estimates thanks to a pilot project in 2013 in the railway yard of city of östersund, that installation of new switch equipment may save up to 50 % of energy used. This would imply a potential of 74 GWh in total in Sweden.",Undefined,5 November 2017,https://www.trafikverket.se/resa-och-trafik/forskning-och-innovation/,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Investment in assets|Finance",Transport,Undefined,Undefined,Sweden,2011,In force,National,SWE

Measures for increasing competition in the natural gas market and transferring the ensuing benefits to final customers,https://www.iea.org/policies/144-measures-for-increasing-competition-in-the-natural-gas-market-and-transferring-the-ensuing-benefits-to-final-customers,"Implementing the provisions of Law 99/2009 of 13 August 2010, the Italian Council of Ministers approved a Legislative Decree for introducing thresholds of wholesale market shares for operators feeding natural gas into the Italian transport network. This substitutes the existing antitrust ceilings introduced by Legislative Decree no. 164/2000 (which expired at the end of 2010), also identifying new measures for increasing competition in the natural gas market. The Decree provides that antitrust ceilings be calculated with reference to the market share of each operator, taking into account the amount of natural gas input into the national network, purchases in spot markets, and sales to importers in Italy made at national network entry points. Consequently, market shares will not be lower than the amount input to the network. Operators in the natural gas market will have to comply with a maximum share of 40% of domestic consumption. A mechanism of gas release at regulated prices is provided in case an operator fails to comply with the mandatory ceilings on the market share. This ceiling can be raised to 55% in case an operator commits itself to building new storage capacity in Italy for a total of 4 bcm within five years. The decree introduces measures for increasing competition in the natural gas market aiming at transferring the ensuing benefits to final customers, increasing storage capacity, supporting the security of supplies and enhancing flexibility in the gas system. To achieve this target, compensation to municipalities interested by the construction of new storage fields has been provided. Furthermore, in 2011 AEEG is expected to publish a new regulation concerning economic compensation mechanisms in the natural gas market.",Undefined,5 November 2017,http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:2010-08-13;130,Energy Efficiency,"Regulation|Renewable / Non-fossil energy obligations|Energy efficiency / Fuel economy obligations|Payments, finance and taxation|Performance-based policies|Payments and transfers|Grants","Transport|Power, Heat and Utilities",Undefined,Undefined,Italy,2010,In force,National,ITA

High-opportunity sectors are:  - Offshore wind;  - Civil nuclear power;  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS);  - Ultra-low carbon vehicles;  - Low-carbon buildings and construction;  - Low-carbon aerospace;  - Chemicals and industrial biotechnology;  - Low-carbon electronics and ICT (Information and Communication Technologies);  - Business and financial services; and  - Carbon markets.  The Strategy included specific support for certain low-carbon sectors, including low-carbon energy sources. Measures include up to GBP 120 million for the development of an offshore wind industry, GBP 60 million for a package of measures to accelerate wave and tidal energy development and deployment, and capital investment of GBP 15 million for a Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre to facilitate joint development and production of high quality nuclear components by around 30 companies.  Several funding initiatives also targeted electric vehicles, with GBP 230 million for consumer incentives to reduce the price of electric and plug-in hybrid cars from 2011, GBP 30 million for electric vehicle charging infrastructure development, and the establishment of a cross-Whitehall Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV).  In addition GBP 6 million in funding supported the construction of 60 or more low-carbon affordable homes, GBP 12 million allocated for a new open access demonstrator facility for fermentation of up to 10 tonnes for industrial biotechnologies, and a fund of GBP 2.5million over the next two years will support SMEs in using the facility.  The Manufacturing Advisory Service was expanded, with GBP 4 million in funding, to provide specialist advice to manufacturers on competing for low carbon opportunities, including support for suppliers for the civil nuclear industry. General priorities for low-carbon development included greater energy efficiency, smarter low-carbon procurement and the construction or retrofit of low carbon buildings.   A suite of measures to facilitate the commercialisation of low-carbon innovation and research were also outlined in the LCIS.

Preferential loans for energy saving measures,https://www.iea.org/policies/1806-preferential-loans-for-energy-saving-measures,"On 5 October 2006, the French Government announced the creation of a EUR 10 billion fund for the funding of domestic energy conservation projects with low-interest loans. Available from 1 January 2007, the low-interest loans are based on a previous tax-free savings account known as the CODEVI (Compte pour le Développement Industriel). This savings product allowed banks to finance the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  The CODEVI as of 1 January 2007 has been renamed the LDD (Livret de Développement Durable), and banks must use a portion of these funds to offer preferential loans for domestic energy conservation projects. While the CODEVI was capped at EUR 4600 per person, the LDD cap has been raised to EUR 6000 per person to raise additional funds for these loans. As of 2009 the account pays tax-free interest of 2.5% a year. In 2008, banks must dedicate 2% of the funds to energy conservation loans, rising to 5% in 2009 and 10% thereafter.  Preferential loans can be awarded to individuals, co-properties and entrepreneurs for the purchase and installation of: energy efficient boilers; thermal insulation (walls, windows, shutters); thermal regulation equipment; equipment producing energy from renewable sources; space and water heating equipment using wood or other biomass; heat pumps. Applicants must provide the bank with documents from the equipment installer, certifying that the equipment and installation meets the required energy efficiency criteria. This financial measure is complementary to the 2005 tax credit scheme.

Turning the Corner: An Action Plan to Reduce Greenhouse Gases and Air Pollution,https://www.iea.org/policies/33-turning-the-corner-an-action-plan-to-reduce-greenhouse-gases-and-air-pollution,"On 26 April 2007, the Government of Canada released a plan to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants from industrial emitters. The Action Plan to Reduce Greenhouse Gases and Air Pollution is intended to: 1) impose mandatory targets on industry to achieve a goal of an absolute reduction of 150 megatonnes in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020; 2) impose targets on industry so that air pollution from industry is cut in half by 2015; 3) regulate the fuel efficiency of cars and light duty trucks, beginning with the 2011 model year; and 4) strengthen energy efficiency standards for a number of energy-using products, including light bulbs. On March 10, 2008, the government released the final regulatory framework for industrial greenhouse gas emissions which is expected to achieve approximately 165 megatonnes in direct and indirect emission reductions from the industrial sector by 2020, thereby making a significant contribution to achieving the governments national target of an absolute reduction in Canadas total greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from 2006 levels by 2020. The final framework sets out industrial emission intensity targets that start out tough and get tougher over time. Existing facilities will be required to reduce emission intensity by 18% from 2006 levels by 2010, and by a further 2% each year after that. Facilities that began operating in 2004 or later will face tougher targets based on cleaner fuels and cleaner technologies. Coal-fired power plants and oil sands plants coming into operation in 2012 or later will face the toughest targets which will effectively require putting in place carbon capture and storage or equivalent technology by 2018. Firms will have access to flexible mechanisms to meet their targets in a cost-effective way. This includes making in-house reductions, taking advantage of domestic emissions trading, offsets, and the Kyoto Protocols Clean Development Mechanism, as well as investing in a technology fund or pre-certified investments drawn from a menu established by the government that will deliver reductions now and in the long term. In addition, firms that reduced their greenhouse gas emissions prior to 2006 will also be rewarded with a one-time credit for early action. The Government of Canada's Turning the Corner Plan was superseded by a sector-by-sector regulatory approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from major-emitting sectors in Canada.",Undefined,5 November 2017,Undefined,Energy Efficiency,Regulation,Buildings|Residential|Industry|Transport,Appliances,Undefined,Canada,2007,In force,National,CAN

Originally, the regulation applied to all petrol stations with sales above 3000 m3, but since 2009 the regulation is stricter and includes all petrol stations with sales of at least 1000 m3.Large investments have been made considering the large amount of petrol stations that have been concerned. The emphasis of investments have lied in the instalment of ethanol pumps, as it is the cheaper alternative compared to pumps for vehicle gas (such as biogas, CNG and methane gas). A subsidy was therefore introduced for instalments of pumps of alternative fuels other than ethanol. The subsidy covered up to 30% of the investment cost after deducting the minimum cost of installing an ethanol pump. The subsidy was not explicitly directed towards a certain type of fuel, but mainly resulted in the instalments of vehicle gas pumps.During 2007-2010, 57 new petrol stations for vehicle gas were set up in Sweden with subsidy.

Companies and non-profit organisations which develop a mobility action plan in order to support a significant modal shift among their employees can get 50% funding of these initiatives from the ""commuterfund"" during the first 4 years. In each Flemish province a mobility desk was created, where companies can get assistance and advice on the development of their commuter plans.

White Certificate Scheme & Obligation,https://www.iea.org/policies/1854-white-certificate-scheme-obligation,"Under the French program of White Certificates Trading, suppliers of energy (electricity, gas, heating oil, LPG, heat, refrigeration) must meet government-mandated targets for energy savings achieved through the suppliers residential and tertiary customers. Suppliers are free to select the actions to meet their objectives, such as informing customers how to reduce energy consumption, running promotional programmes, providing incentives to customers and so on. A list of ratified activities was ratified to help the various actors to facilitate the operations. Those exceeding and undercutting their objectives can trade energy savings certificates as required for common compliance. Energy suppliers who do not meet their obligation over the period (2006-2008) must pay a penalty of euro 0,02 per kWh. Lump evaluation of energy savings are established for each process, expressed in kWh of final energy, cumulated and present-worthed over the life of the product. The first, experimental phase of the scheme will run for three years from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2009. It is intended that during this time, the scheme will result in 54TWh of cumulated energy savings. Following the success of the first period (2006-2009), a second phase was launched on 1st January 2011 (2011-2013) and extended to include vehicle fuel vendors. This second phase will be extended by a year, before the start of the third period which is currently in preparation. The target set during the first period (54 TWhcumac), and split between the energy suppliers according to their sales volumes and energy prices after tax, has been exceeded (65.2 TWhcumac). The target for the second period has been set at 115 TWhcumac/year. The target for the third period has been set at 660 TWhcumac within 3 years. In 2014, decrees and orders regarding the 3rd period of the White Certificate Scheme were published. The 3rd period started on the 1st of January 2015, with an objective of 700 TWh cumac for the 2015-2017 period. In 2018 the target was increased significantly: 1,600 TWh of accumulated and updated energy over the period.In 2022, 100 million euros are invested in 5 energy saving programs, linked with improving energy efficiency in the digital world, SMEs and in the transport sector.

The Bill and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 set up the machinery for the grants scheme.The objective of the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme is to provide grants to (1) fully offset any excise duty or customs duty payable in relation to the manufacture or importation of biodiesel for which a provisional entitlement arises during the period starting on 18áSeptember 2003 and ending on 30áJune 2011; (2) fully offset any excise duty or customs duty payable in relation to the manufacture or importation of renewable diesel for which a provisional entitlement arises during the period starting on 1áJuly 2006 and ending on 30áJune 2011; (3) partially offset any excise duty or customs duty payable in relation to the manufacture or importation of biodiesel, CNG, ethanol, LNG, LPG, methanol or renewable diesel for which a provisional entitlement arises during a transition period starting on 1 July 2011 and ending on 30 June 2015; in the aim of (4) encouraging the manufacture and importation of low sulphur fuels.Production grants for fuel ethanol commenced in September 2002 and were extended in 2004 for a further eight years to June 2011. Grants in relation to biodiesel will apply from 18 September 2003, and will become available for ethanol manufacture and importation once existing ethanol subsidy arrangements expire in 2008.  Grants will be available in relation to the manufacture and importation of low sulphur fuels from 2006 and low sulphur diesel from 2007. As of 2006, grants were 38 cents per litre for ethanol and biodiesel.As detailed in the record of Fuel Tax Reform, these arrangements ensure that the effective rate of excise tax for biofuels is zero until 1 July 2011. The cleaner fuels grants scheme encourages the manufacture or importation of fuels that have a reduced impact on the environment. If you manufacture or import cleaner fuels that meet the relevant fuel quality standard under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, you may be entitled to a cleaner fuels grant.Eligible cleaner fuels are: biodiesel and renewable diesel.There is no cleaner fuel grant for fuel ethanol, however there is a production grant for domestic production of fuel ethanol.

Value of fringe benefits for company cars,https://www.iea.org/policies/2251-value-of-fringe-benefits-for-company-cars,"A significant share of the new car sales consists of so-called benefit cars. A benefit car is a company car where the employer offers the employee to use it also for private driving. These cars risk becoming heavier and more fuel consuming than the rest of the vehicle fleet. To counteract this development, the rules have been gradually altered since 1997. Initially the changes aimed at making the employee pay for the fuel used for private driving and thereby increase the incentives for more efficient driving and less consuming cars.In December 2001, the government implemented new legislation with lower benefit value for environmentally friendly cars driven on biofuels in order to stimulate the sale of new cars with these properties. More than a decade later, the same reasoning remains valid, although the rules have been changed several times, including the very definition of environmentally-friendly cars.The benefit value for cars that can be driven by ethanol (E85), natural gas or biogas is lowered by 20 % compared to a similar gasoline driven model. The maximum reduction is SEK 8000 annually. The benefit value for hybrids or electric vehicles can be lowered by 40 % in comparison to corresponding conventional vehicle. The maximum reduction is SEK 16 000 annually. Starting from 2011, the benefit value is set at 60 or 80% of the corresponding non-environmentally friendly vehicle.Starting in 2012, full reduction is only allowed for plug-in hybrids and vehicles running on biogas.For cars driven by LPG, the benefit value can be lowered to the same level of corresponding conventional car.The main incentive for the rules is to choose a car driven by alternative fuels, but also to reduce the distance driven. This is to be reached through a fuel benefit which is estimated as the market value multiplied by 1.2 when driving the car in private.",Undefined,5 November 2017,http://www.skatteverket.se/rattsinformation/reglerochstallningstaganden/meddelanden/2012/meddelanden2012/skvm201221.5.2b543913a42158acf800023139.html,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Payments and transfers",Transport,Undefined,Undefined,Sweden,2002,In force,National,SWE

Differentiated levy on heavy duty traffic,https://www.iea.org/policies/2582-differentiated-levy-on-heavy-duty-traffic,"Heavy duty vehicles pay a levy per km which varies regarding EURO-emission standard. Electric and hydrogen HDV are exempted from the tax. The ultimate goal of the policy is to internalize all external cost of heavy duty transport transiting the Swiss alps and to incentivize the shift to train cargo.  The heavy-duty (> 3.5 tonnes) vehicle fee (HVF) was introduced in 2001. Its prime goal is to internalise external road transport costs. The HVF is calculated on distance, weight and emissions standards, replacing a previous flat fee. Its initial rate was CHF 0.017/tonne/km, rising to CHF 0.025/tonne/km as from 1.1.2005; it will level off at a maximum CHF 0.0275/tonne/km in 2008. Parallel to the rate increases, the maximum lorry weight was lifted to 34 tonnes in 2001 and to 40 tonnes in 2005. This gradual approach gave hauliers time to improve productivity, which partly offset the cost of the HVF. In the first four years since the introduction of the HVF road transport costs have increased by some 6%. Two-thirds of HVF revenues are allocated to construction of rail infrastructure (including two trans-Alpine railway tunnels) to support modal shift. Annual revenues ranged between CHF 800-900 million (EUR 515-580 million) in the first four years and rose to some CHF 1.3 billion (EUR 840 million) in 2005. The HVF resulted from protracted bilateral transport negotiations with the EU. Switzerland was concerned that the lifting of the then prevailing 28- tonne limit on lorries, as demanded by the EU, would unleash massive transit traffic and seriously jeopardize constitutionally mandated modal shift and sustainability policies. The introduction of the HVF was approved by a 57% majority of the Swiss people in 1998. The effects of the HVF (as well as higher truck load limitations) are compelling. Freight mileage decreased 8% in 2001-04 after decade-long uninterrupted growth, while transported freight volumes actually increased. There was virtually no traffic rerouting through neighbouring countries. Transit mileage through the Alps decreased 8%. The decline was the steepest in the first two years due to fleet modernisation and efficiency gains. Provisional data for 2005 indicates a -3% mileage decline because of the rate increase. Modelling indicates that by 2007 CO2 emissions from road freight transport will be 6-8% below what would have happened without the new regime with HVF and higher weight limit. The main effects on transit are expected when high-performance modal shift infrastructure will become operational. Long-term, road freight mileage growth will resume in Switzerland, because of overall European transport trends, albeit more moderately than in the past. However, the share of rail transport in Switzerland is expected to grow from currently 39% to 47% by 2030, thereby reversing past trends.  The current rates are 0.0031 CHF/tkm for Euro 3 trucks and below, 0.00269/tkm for Euro 4 and 5 trucks and 0.0026 CHF/tkm for Euro 6 trucks.",Undefined,5 November 2017,Levy on heavy duty traffic,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Taxes, fees and charges|Vehicle registration tax|Product taxation",Transport|Road transport,Road vehicles|Heavy trucks|Transport technologies,Undefined,Switzerland,2001,In force,National,CHE

Vehicle Excise Duty (VED),https://www.iea.org/policies/1683-vehicle-excise-duty-ved,"All cars in the UK are subject to an annual tax called the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED). Before 2001, Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) was the same flat rate for all cars. In March 2001, the VED was reformed to incentivise fuel-efficient, low-carbon vehicles and to send a clear environmental signal to motorists that driving less fuel efficient vehicles will be more expensive. Under this scheme, cars registered from March 2001 onwards are placed into VED rate bands according to their CO2 emissions. Within each band, alternatively fuelled cars, including hybrid vehicles, benefit from a small discount of GBP5 to GBP10, while diesel cars with lower carbon dioxide emission rates than similar petrol cars pay a small supplement to compensate for the fact that diesel cars may emit higher levels of particulates and other local air pollutants such as NOx. The excise scheme is revenue-neutral. Further amendments to the scheme were made in Budget 2002, with the introduction of a new low carbon VED rate for cars that emit less than 120 g/km of CO2. This increased the VED differential between the least and most polluting cars to up to GBP100 per year. Under Budget 2002 the rate of VED for cars producing less than 120 g/km CO2 was  £60/year for cars using alternative fuel, GBP70/year for cars using petrol and GBP80/year for cars using diesel. In 2006, the bands ranged from A to G, classified as follows in CO2 emissions in g/km: A: 0-100; B: 101-120; C: 121-150; D: 151-165; E: 166-185; F: 186 and over (cars registered before 23 March 2006); G: 226 and over (cars registered before 23 March 2006). That same year the government further reduced the VED for the lowest emission cars to zero. In addition, it increased VED for the most polluting cars (graduated VED band G) to GBP 300 from 2007 and to GBP 400 from 2008. VED for band B cars was reduced to GBP 35 per year, while increasing by GBP 5 for all other bands from C to F in 2008. The government also issued new motorcycle VED rates and reformed the company car tax and fuel scale charges for fuel provided for private use. Additionally, a new system of lorry VED came into effect from 1 December 2001. This system was designed to reduce the total burden that lorry VED imposes on the haulage industry, while at the same time improving the environmental signals that haulers face by encouraging the use of lorries that cause less road damage and pollution. Additionally, heavy goods vehicles fitted with certain emission reduction technologies, e.g. particulate traps, or converted to natural gas, have for some time benefited from lower VED rates under the Reduced Pollution Certificate scheme. In 2006, the government developed proposals for lorry road user charging. Announced in 2008, a major overhaul of the VED system took effect in 2009, with the seven bands being expanded to 13 (see separate entry).",Undefined,5 November 2017,http://www.dvla.gov.uk/newved.htm,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation|Payments and transfers",Transport|Road transport|Freight transport (Road),"Road vehicles|Commercial vehicles|Medium duty vehicles, small trucks and minibuses|Heavy trucks|Transport technologies",Undefined,United Kingdom,2001,In force,National,GBR

Green Vehicle Guide,https://www.iea.org/policies/990-green-vehicle-guide,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys (EPAs) Green Vehicle Guide is designed to give consumers information about the environmental performance of vehicles. The annually updated guide covers the latest vehicle models on the market. The Green Vehicle Guide provides consumers with fuel economy and emission (air pollution and greenhouse gas) information for all models and configurations of cars and light trucks sold in the United States. Consumers can use the Green Vehicle Guide to find the cleanest, most fuel-efficient vehicle that meets their needs. Each vehicle is given an environmental score on a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the best, based on emission levels and fuel economy values. The best environmental performers receive the SmartWay designation, which means the vehicle scores well on both Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gas. Each year a vehicles scores and SmartWay status reflect its environmental performance relative to other vehicles for model years with the same scoring thresholds only. Users can compare individual vehicles or vehicle types in terms of fuel effciency and emissions. The Green Vehicle Guide website allows side-by-side comparisons for up to three vehicles and searches that can be customized based on user choices. For example, because some versions of vehicles are only available in certain states, the Green Vehicle Guide allows consumers to search by state. Recently, additional content was added such that clean diesel vehicles can be found in the listing for California and other states that have adopted Californias stringent emissions standards.
