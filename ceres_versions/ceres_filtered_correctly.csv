on diesel oil, as well as light fuel oil for commercial,_x000D__x000D_
industrial and heating purposes and heavy fuel oil. An_x000D__x000D_
excise duty on certain energy sources is levied on coal, milled peat, natural gas, electricity and pine oil._x000D__x000D_
Additives and extenders in fuels are subject to the_x000D__x000D_
excise duty under the same principles as the fuel in_x000D__x000D_
question. Light fuel oil, vaporising oil and paraffin oil_x000D__x000D_
must contain a reactive reagent for revealing_x000D__x000D_
unauthorized use._x000D__x000D_
The excise duties were revised in 1993<U+2013>94, in line_x000D__x000D_
with the EU regulation. The duty consists of a basic tax and an additional environmentally based tax. The basic duty is primarily a fiscal tax determined annually in the State budget proposal. The basic duty is, however, differentiated to promote environmental protection._x000D__x000D_
In the case of motor petrol, there is a lower tax on_x000D__x000D_
unleaded and reformulated grades, and in the case of_x000D__x000D_
diesel oil on the desulphurized grade. The basic duty_x000D__x000D_
is also levied on light and heavy fuel oil, pine oil and_x000D__x000D_
nuclear power. Tax revenues derive primarily from liquid traffic fuels, however._x000D__x000D_
The additional environmentally based duty was_x000D__x000D_
determined in 1994<U+2013>96 according to the energy and_x000D__x000D_
carbon content of the fuel or energy source. As a rule,_x000D__x000D_
the tax was imposed on primary energy inputs, thus_x000D__x000D_
encouraging improvements in energy efficiency and_x000D__x000D_
production techniques._x000D__x000D_
The yardstick when calculating the additional tax for_x000D__x000D_
the years 1994<U+2013>96 was heavy fuel oil; 75% of the tax_x000D__x000D_
was based on the carbon content and 25% on the_x000D__x000D_
energy content. Therefore, the Finnish CO2 tax system was often referred to as the <U+201D>75/25 model<U+201D> as opposed to the <U+201D>50/50 model<U+201D> proposed within the EU. In 1996, the tax component on carbon content was FIM 38.3 per tonne CO2 and that on energy content FIM 3.5 per MWh. The additional taxes on all fuels are determined according to unit taxes worked out in this way._x000D__x000D_
For nuclear and hydropower, the additional environment tax was levied only on energy content. The energy duty component for nuclear power was the same as for electricity generated in coal-fired condensing plants, where the efficiency coefficient is about 38%. The duty on hydropower was worked out by applying the standard rate of energy content directly to the amount of electricity generated._x000D__x000D_
As a general rule, no additional tax is levied on_x000D__x000D_
renewable energy sources. Thus, for example, wind_x000D__x000D_
power and the use of waste and wood-based biomass_x000D__x000D_
are not taxed. Only the energy component of the duty_x000D__x000D_
applied to peat, as a consequence of the VAT reform._x000D__x000D_
The estimated revenues from the excise duty on_x000D__x000D_
fuels and energy products in 1996 were FIM 13.6_x000D__x000D_
billion, representing 2% of GDP. The basic tax accounted for FIM 11 billion and the additional duty for_x000D__x000D_
FIM 2.6 billion. About 60% of additional duty revenues_x000D__x000D_
came from the carbon dioxide component and 40%_x000D__x000D_
from the energy component._x000D__x000D_
The problem with the system was that few countries_x000D__x000D_
have introduced corresponding taxes. Even those which have, have tried to safeguard the competitiveness of their industry either through low tax levels or by granting special concessions. This was especially the case with domestic electricity production, which was no longer competitive in the liberalized Nordic electricity market._x000D__x000D_
The tax on imported electricity probably also went_x000D__x000D_
against the Treaty of Rome._x000D__x000D_

The Energy Audit Programme is a voluntary programme promoted by a 40 to 50 per cent subsidy by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy. The ministry provides subsidies for conducting energy audits on commercial and public buildings and in the industrial and energy sectors. It also supports municipalities to carry out audits concerning the promotion of renewable energy use within the municipality<U+2019>s territory (Renewable Energy Municipal Audit). Apart from energy audits subsidised by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, there are energy audits intended for blocks of flats and terraced housing. Subsidies for private sector buildings are granted by municipalities, whereas subsidies for municipal housing stock are granted by the Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland (ARA). The Ministry of the Environment determines the total annual amount of these subsidies. By the end of 2010, the estimated savings in energy achieved by conducting audits in the service, municipal and industry sectors were approximately 1.0 TWh per year. About 90 per cent of the savings originated in the industry sector. The corresponding CO2 reduction was 0.98 million tonnes CO2 per year (based on a marginal emissions rate of 600 kg CO2/MWh for_x000D__x000D_

published in November 2012, estimated that through socially cost-effective investment in energy_x000D_

the UK 154 TWh in 2020._x000D_
The Energy Efficiency Strategy identified four key barriers to the deployment of cost-effective_x000D_
energy efficiency investments in the UK economy:_x000D_
Embryonic markets: The UK already has an energy efficiency market but it is small relative to_x000D_
the size of the opportunity. There are significant economic benefits to be realised from growing_x000D_
this market and making energy efficiency a mainstream activity._x000D_
Information: There is currently a lack of access to trusted and appropriate energy efficiency_x000D_
information. Where information is available it may be generic and not tailored to specific_x000D_
circumstances, which means that enterprises are not able to fully assess the benefits of an_x000D_
energy efficiency investment._x000D_
Misaligned financial incentives: Those investing in energy efficiency measures are not always_x000D_
the ones receiving the direct benefit. For example, the wider benefits of energy efficiency_x000D_
investment, such as improved security of supply and reduced carbon emissions, are not always_x000D_
realised by those making the investment._x000D_
Undervaluing energy efficiency: Partly as a result of the lack of trusted information,_x000D_
the long-term benefits of improved energy efficiency are often regarded as less certain._x000D_
Consequently, energy efficiency is undervalued relative to other investment options and not_x000D_
prioritised as it might otherwise be._x000D_
Over the last twelve months, the UK has made good progress towards overcoming these_x000D_
barriers. The introduction of new policies and the simplification of existing ones has resulted_x000D_
in: expanded choice and support for households; simplified and extended support for UK_x000D_
businesses and the public sector; improved access to financing for energy efficiency measures;_x000D_

- Double the energy self-sufficiency ratio (18% at present, including nuclear power generation) and the domestically-developed fossil fuel supply ratio* (26% at present), and raise the energy independence ratio to about 70 percent from the present 38 percent._x000D_
*The ratio of fossil fuel supply from domestic and overseas interests that a Japanese company has a share in the total supply_x000D_
- Raise the ratio of energy from zero-emission power sources such as nuclear and renewable energy to 70 percent (by more than 50% in 2020) from the present 34%. For this purpose:_x000D_
Build more than 14 additional nuclear plants (nine by 2020)._x000D_
Raise the overall plant capacity utilization rate to 90 percent (85% by 2020) from the 60% in 2008._x000D_
Maximize the use of renewable energy._x000D_
Cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the residential sector by half._x000D_
Maintain and raise energy efficiency in the industrial sector to the highest level in the world._x000D_
Maintain or achieve top-level shares of global markets for energy-related products and systems._x000D_
According to the plan, the goal is to reduce domestic energy-related CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030 compared to the 1990 level. Its intention was to increase nuclear energy in the mix to raise Japan's level of energy self-sufficiency, on the assumption this would also enhance energy security. (Although Japan imports all the uranium it needs for nuclear power generation, nuclear power was deemed a ""quasi-domestic energy"" because the government considers it possible to recycle nuclear fuel at home, if the nuclear fuel cycle is based on reprocessing used fuel and using it in fast-breeder reactors.)

The 1994 decree determined the fixed tariff for solar electricity at ESP 10.42/kWh (<U+20AC> 0.06/kWh). The Royal Decree (2818/1998) increased the tariff for solar electricity to <U+20AC> 0.22 to <U+20AC> 0.39/kWh. In 2000, it was revised and a new price at which a utility or supplier has to purchase renewable electricity from private generators was fixed. It ranges from <U+20AC> 0.03/kWh (for secondary biomass) to <U+20AC> 0.39/kWh (for PV under 5 kW). From 1999, wind electricity producers could receive either a fixed tariff of <U+20AC> 0.06/kWh or the average hourly market price of electricity plus a bonus of <U+20AC> 0.03/kWh. Rates are specified for both capacity and output credits. Output credits are the highest for wind and solar plants: <U+20AC> 0.07/kWh over a five-year period. Capacity credits are the highest for waste incineration plants; output credits for these plants vary depending on the size of the plant and on the relative importance of any co-fired fossil fuel. They also decrease annually. Buy-back rates for these plants are about <U+20AC> 0.06/kWh in the first year. Buy-back rates also depend on continuity of supply to avoid surges in power sold to the grid. The legislation also provides for guaranteed access to the electricity grid, with agreed rates for connection.

In a first step to completely phase out fossil fuels the government targets the drop in the consumption of oil, gas and coal by 33% between 2009 and 2020._x000D_
The share of thermal production in total energy generation should also decrease from 71% to 40% over the same period._x000D_
To reach 100% of electricity from renewable, the Danish government greatly focuses on wind energy, expected to provide for 40% of total electricity needs, together with biomass and biogas. A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector._x000D_
Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector._x000D_
In the building sector, the Danish government is going a step forward in implementing very ambitious building code, banning oil boilers in all new constructions and, by 2017, in all houses while biomass, biogas and solar thermal appliances will be strongly encouraged._x000D_
Denmark also targets the large scale deployment of offshore wind as well as dramatic growth in the wind manufacturing sector, and will fund research and development in for solar and wave power, support main demonstration projects for large heat pumps intended to be used in district heating plants and fund other geothermal energy research projects._x000D_
In order to generate revenues to finance the energy shift of the country, Denmark will introduce a public service obligation tax on electricity and gas, while tax on oil, gas and coal will be further increased to discourage their use.

The new renewable energy law establishes more ambitious national renewable energy targets that should reach 20% of total national energy consumption and 40% of total electricity consumption by 2020. Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources. The new legislation foresees the creation of a Special Renewable Energy Investment Service that will act as an interface between public institutions and investors, annually assess the main challenges to renewable energy deployment and manage the support funding allocation process. Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills. In fact, the law establishes that a share of the RE concession taxes paid by RE producers to regional and local authorities will will be allocated to local households as a credit on their electricity bill as a way to share the benefits of living nearby a renewable energy generation plant. The renewable energy generation licensing process has also been very much fasten and eased by the regulation that entitles the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) with the assessment and issuance of licences, under the authority of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. The whole licensing process can not last over a 30-month period. Moreover, absolute priority is given to RES projects combined with desalination plants, when and only when the RES project is on an island and its capacity does not exceed 25% of the capacity of the desalination plant. The law also tackles the grid infrastructure challenge and implements a timely limited target for the grid utility to connect non-interconnected islands to the main grid. Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated. The grid utility is compelled to provide grid access within four months after the connection demand has been released. The Law 3851 also establishes a whole new set of feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable sources, to be found in the Greek FIT article.

To do so, emergency measures ranging form 2011 to 2013 have been taken by the Cabinet of Ministers. The main measures are: 1) As of January 1st 2011, electricity generators from both special and ordinary regimes will be required to pay a fee of a value equal to EUR 0.50/MWh for electricity fed into the grid. 2) As already witnessed for wind and thermal power installations, the number of equivalent hours of solar photovolatic generated electricity eligible for government support is limited. Once that limit is reached, the excess electricity generated by that particular installation during that particular year will not be supported and will be sold at the wholesale electricity market price. Between 2011 and 2013, the share of equivalent hours will remain as established in the Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010 and concerned power stations will then enjoy three extra years of Government support, scaling up the support period from 25 to 28 years.

Each year- a predefined (and annually increasing) percentage of electricity supplied to end users has to be covered by green electricity. Suppliers must restitute the necessary number of green certificates to demonstrate that they respect that rule. In case of failure- a penalty fee is due. This situation creates a market for green certificates for the benefit of green electricity producers.  Shares are regularly updated by regional regulation authorities. 3.

The installations subject to EU ETS covers about half of Danish emissions of greenhouse gases. Statutory and administrative basis for the scheme have been established. Allowances prices have particular significance for Danish emissions as they affect the need to initiate other mitigation initiatives. Introducing the Marked Stability Reserve has had major impact on price levels thus supporting national efforts.

A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector.Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector.In the building sector, the Danish government is going a step forward in implementing very ambitious building code, banning oil boilers in all new constructions and, by 2017, in all houses while biomass, biogas and solar thermal appliances will be strongly encouraged.Denmark also targets the large scale deployment of offshore wind as well as dramatic growth in the wind manufacturing sector, and will fund research and development in for solar and wave power, support main demonstration projects for large heat pumps intended to be used in district heating plants and fund other geothermal energy research projects.In order to generate revenues to finance the energy shift of the country, Denmark will introduce a public service obligation tax on electricity and gas, while tax on oil, gas and coal will be further increased to discourage their use.With regards to nuclear, the country has maintained its ban on nuclear power programme and, since there is no potential for large hydropower project , most of the funding will be dedicated to new renewable sources.","https://www.iea.org/policies/5122-energy-strategy-2050",2011,NA,NA,"IEA"

Under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, the US EPA established interim and final CO2 emissions performance rates for two subcategories of fossil fuel-fired electric generation units:    Fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units (generally, coal- and oil-fired power plants);  Natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units  To maximize the range of choices available to states in implementing the standards and to utilities in meeting them, the EPA established interim and final statewide goals in three forms:  A rate-based state goal measured in pounds per megawatt hour (lb/MWh);  A mass-based state goal measured in total short tons of CO2;  A mass-based state goal with a new source complement measured in total short tons of CO2.  States then develop and implement plans that ensure that the power plants in their state - either individually, together or in combination with other measures - achieve the interim CO2 emissions performance rates over the period of 2022 to 2029 and the final CO2 emission performance rates, rate-based goals or mass-based goals by 2030.  Through the best system of emissions reduction available, the rule determined three ""Building Blocks"" for states to achieve the interim and final emissions reductions targets.  These blocks are:  Building Block 1: reducing the carbon intensity of electricity generation by improving the heat rate of existing coal-fired power plants;  Building Block 2: substituting increased electricity generation from lower-emitting existing natural gas plants for reduced generation from higher-emitting coal fired power plants;  Building Block 3: substituting increased electricity generation from new zero-emitting renewable energy sources (like wind and solar) for reduced generation from existing coal-fired power plants.   Once the state has developed a plan to reduce emissions and the EPA issues approval, the state has 15 years for full implementation. Within the time frame, there will be three interim goals that the states must meet to ensure compliance with the final emissions reduction goal.  On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review. On October 10, 2018, EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan,  after completing a thorough review as directed by the Energy Independence Executive Order.","https://www.iea.org/policies/829-clean-power-plan",2015,NA,NA,"IEA"

"3063",4785,4785,"Germany","DEU",NA,"2012 Amendment of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG 2012)","On 1 January 2012 the amendment of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) will come into force (EEG 2012). In agreement with the Energy Concept of the government dating from September 2010, it aims at reaching the following minimum shares of renewable energy in electricity supply:35% by 202050% by 203065% by 2040<U+00A0>80% by 2050The basic principles of the EEG, in particular priority purchase, transport and distribution of electricity generated from renewable energy sources as well as statutory feed-in compensation, remain unchanged.According to the growing share of renewables in the total electricity production, market integration, system integration and grid integration gain considerably in importance. Main mechanisms to improve integration are:- A market premium (optional for all renewables, from 2014 compulsory for new biogas facilities).- A flexibility premium (for new and existing biogas facilities).- A rebate in compensation payments for utility companies selling electricity generated at least 50 % from fluctuating renewable energy sources, inclusion of photovoltaic plants in the feed-in management, as well as supporting instruments outside the EEG.With respect to the latter a number of measures were adopted as part of the energy package of the Federal cabinet, among which an act amending provisions of energy business legislation (""Gesetz zur Neuregelung energiewirtschaftsrechtlicher Vorschriften""), an act on measures to accelerate the expansion of the electricity grid (""Gesetz <U+00FC>ber Ma<U+00DF>nahmen zur Beschleunigung des Ausbaus der Elektrizit<U+00E4>tsnetze"") and others.The feed-in tariff structure for onshore wind<U+00A0>remains mainly unchanged. The initial tariff of EUR Cent 8.93/kilowatt-hour (kWh) will be decreased every year for new installations by 1.5 percent, as opposed to one percent in the EEG 2009. Instead of limiting the payment of the system service bonus, fixed at EUR cent 0.48/kWh for the year 2012, to the end of 2013, it will be paid until end of 2014 for new and until end of 2015 for existing facilities. The repowering bonus of EUR Cent 0.5/kWh (to support the replacement of old turbines by new ones) is restricted to wind turbines that were put into operation before the year 2002.For offshore wind, the initial tariff remains at EUR Cent 15/kWh. The tariff for new turbines will not be decreased before the year 2018 (instead of 2015 initially), with a then 7% annual rate of degression ( 5% intially). To accelerate repayment of investment in offshore wind farms an optional feed-in tariff model was introduced, which offers an initial tariff of EUR Cent 19 /kWh paid for 8 years (standard model: EUR cent 15/kWh for 12 years).A number of further supporting measures outside the EEG are taken to stimulate offshore wind energy, among others a dedicated loan programme of the KfW bank.For hydropower<U+00A0>the tariff structure is simplified and harmonised: the differentiation between new and modernised facilities is abandoned, the feed-in tariff will be paid for 20 years and the initial remuneration will decrease by one percent per year. Initial tariffs are: - up to 500 kilowat: EUR Cent 12.7/kWhEUR - up to 2 megawatt (MW): EUR Cent 8.3/kWh - up to 5 MW: EUR Cent 6.3 ct/kWh - up to 10 MW:EUR Cent 5.5 ct/kWh - up to 20 MW: EUR Cent 5.3 ct/kWh - up to 50 MW: EUR Cent 4.2 ct/kWh - over 50 MW: EUR Cent 3.4 ct/kWh .For biomass<U+00A0>facilities tariffs decrease by 10 to 15 per cent on average, compared to the EEG 2009. Biogas plants only qualify for remuneration if they comply with basic requirements: at least 60 per cent of the heat produced is used, or the facility is operated using 60 per cent or more of slurry, or the electricity is sold directly.Furthermore electricity from<U+00A0>biogas<U+00A0>may not be based on more than 60 per cent of maize and grain. The tariff structure is simplified and harmonised, having 4 capacity-oriented categories (basic tariff from EUR Cent 6 to 14.3/kWh).<U+00A0>Additional remuneration is paid depending on the type of biomass used as fuel (from EUR Cent 2.5 to 8/kWh). Small facilities on farms that deploy at least 80 per cent slurry receive a remuneration of 25 ct/kWh. Furthermore there is a special tariff for waste biomass fermentation plants. A bonus of EUR Cent 1 to 3/kWh is paid for processing and feed-in of bio-methane. The initial basic tariff decreases by two percent per year, whereas the fuel-related tariff does not change.Tariffs for geothermal facilities increase from EUR Cent 23 to 25/kWh; initial tariffs decrease by 5 percent annually from 2018.The bonus for use of petrothermal technology increases from EUR Cent 4 to 5/kWh.The tariff structure of the EEG 2009 for photovoltaic plants is continued. The tariff may be decreased twice a year depending on the capacity newly built in the previous period: on 1 January tariffs decrease between 1.5 per cent and 24 per cent (basic degression rate of 9 per cent for an additional capacity installed between 2,500 and 3,500 MW). A part of the decrease (0 to 15 per cent) can be antedated on 1 July, if capacity expansion exceeds defined threshold values. The special tariff for electricity consumed within the building or site of production remains in force until end of the year 2013. New free-standing facilities on conversion areas in natural reserves and national parks are not eligible for remuneration.To improve grid integration of PV facilities over 100 kW underlie feed-in management, for facilities over 30 kW a simplified feed-in management will apply. Smaller facilities may also participate in the latter, or alternatively may feed in a maximum of 70 per cent of their installed power.To limit the increase of total feed-in-payments an amendment referring to PV facilites ('PV-Novelle') was agreed on end of June 2012, but effective 1 April 2012. Main components of this amendment are an overall target of 52 Gigawatt of PV power reimbursed according to the feed-in tariff (FIT), an extra decrease of tariffs, a modification of the degression scheme reducing tariffs by 1% monthly (corresponding to a basic degression rate of ca. 11.4% p.a.), the introduction of a new category for roof-top facilities and the limitation of the total power of a facility to 10 Megawatt.With effect from 1 January 2013 the management premium (which is part of the market premium) for wind and PV facilities is reduced.","https://www.iea.org/policies/5117-2012-amendment-of-the-renewable-energy-sources-act-eeg-2012",2012,NA,NA,"IEA"

According to the Agreement in 2020 half of the electricity consumption will come from wind power, enabling a share of 35% renewable energy in gross energy consumption in 2020. Moreover, the energy consumption is to decrease by more than 12 % in 2020 compared to 2006. The initiatives in the Agreement will lead to CO2 emissions in 2020 being  34% lower than they were in 1990. At the same time, the Agreement is to ensure a stable framework for the business community as a whole, and the energy sector in particular.   Renewable energy in power generation The Agreement secures substantial expansion of wind power, corresponding to the annual consumption of 1 <U+00BD> million households. Thus in 2020, wind power will account for approximately 50% of Danish electricity consumption. The Agreement implies that: 600 MW offshore wind turbines will be built at Kriegers Flak and 400 MW offshore wind turbines will be built at Horns Rev before 2020; a further 500 MW offshore wind turbines will be installed near the coast before 2020; new planning tools will encourage development of onshore wind turbines with a total capacity of 1,800 MW up until 2020; over a period of four years, a total of DKK 100 million will be committed to funding development and use of new renewable energy technologies for electricity production (solar, waves ,etc.) as well as DKK 25 million for wave power demonstration facilities. Energy-efficiency  measures With the Agreement initiatives, in 2020 Denmark will have reduced its final energy consumption (excluding consumption for transport) by almost 8% compared to 2010. The Agreement contains the following elements: energy companies must realise specific energy savings exceeding today requirements, e.g. by consulting energy experts and by offering subsidies to e.g. households and businesses; energy companies must increase efforts by 75% from 2013 to 2014, and by 100% from 2015 to 2020 compared to 2010-12; a comprehensive strategy for energy renovation of all Danish buildings will be developed. Green heating measures: converting from coal to biomass at large-scale power plants will be made more attractive by amending the Heating Supply Act; the smaller open-field plants that are struggling in the wake of high heating prices will be allowed to produce cheap heating based on biomass; DKK 35 million will be committed to promoting new renewable technologies, e.g. geothermal energy and large heat pumps. Renewable energy in buildings   The Agreement supports the phasing-out of oil-fired boilers in existing buildings by: banning installation of oil-fired boilers and natural gas boilers in new buildings from 2013; banning installation of new oil-fired boilers in existing buildings in areas where district heating or natural gas is available from 2016; committing DKK 42 million in 2012-15 to fund the conversion from oil-fired boilers and natural gas boilers in existing buildings to renewable energy. Renewable energy in industry Industry must also convert to a greener energy system. Therefore the Agreement lays down that: -                a subsidy should be given to help promote investment in energy efficient use of renewable energy in the production processes of enterprises. In the period 2014 to 2020, the subsidy will be increased to DKK 500 million a year from DKK 250 million in 2013: -                  funding of DKK 30 million per year from 2013 to 2020 will be introduced to maintain and promote industrial CHP in industries and greenhouses. Deployment of Smart Grids Large electricity consumption in combination with wind power requires an intelligent energy system. Therefore the Agreement lays down that: a comprehensive strategy for establishing smart grids in Denmark is to be drawn up; An expansion of biogas is also to be implemented. In order to create momentum in this must improve the economic conditions for biogas production and biogas must to a greater extent than today could be used outside the cogeneration sector. The parties are, therefore, agree that it total support for biogas used for cogeneration or sent out into the natural gas network should be able toreceive support of DKK 115 / GJ in 2012;  In the long term, the transport sector must undergo a radical transformation from fossil fuels to new ones propellants such as electricity and biomass; Investments in research, development and demonstration are prerequisites for Danish companies in so that they can develop and sell green solutions and create green jobs in the long term.","https://www.iea.org/policies/606-danish-energy-agreement-for-2012-2020",2012,NA,NA,"IEA"

"3071",4811,4811,"Italy","ITA",NA,"Feed-in premium for renewable energy sources other than photovoltaic","A level of 5.8 billion Euros per year has been set in aggregate for all incentives to be paid under the regime of incentives for renewable energies excluding solar PV. The new incentive starts to be granted from the 1st of January, 2013. Plants that were already permitted before the date of entry into force of the decree and that will enter into operation by 30 April 2013 may, however, decide to be admitted to the green certificates regime (anyway they may be converted into the new regime in the future).The application for the granting of the incentives is regulated depending upon the capacity of the plant and different systems are provided for:(i) a competitive tender with the winning bid being the offer for the lowest possible tariff level,(ii) for mid-sized plants a system of tariff booking by means of a non-directly competitive pre-registration process, and(iii) for the smallest ones of the plants a system by way of a direct application upon commissioning.Refitting of existing plants are exempt from tendering. In order to access the tariffs following categories of plants shall go through competitive tenders:(i) new plants, fully re-built ones, and restarted plants with capacities above the threshold triggering the tender,(ii) hybrid plants with capacities above the threshold triggering the tender, and(iii) repowered plants for which the capacity gap exceeds the threshold triggering the tender.<U+00A0>The threshold triggering the tender is equal to 5 MW, except for hydro for which it is 10 MW and geothermal for which it is 20 MW. The tendered capacities are those indicated in Annex 1.The following categories of plants shall go through the booking by means of preregistration:(i) new plants, fully re-built ones, and restarted plants with capacities not exceeding the threshold triggering the tender,(ii) hybrid plants with capacities not exceeding the threshold triggering the tender,(iii) partially or totally refitted plants (within certain limits set forth under the FER decree), and(iv) repowered plants for which the capacity gap does not exceed the threshold triggering the tender.Between the communication of the registration and the entry into operation the maximum time gap shall be(i) 16 months for onshore wind,(ii) 22 months for offshore wind,(iii) 28 months for hydro,(iv) 28 months for geothermal,(v) from 22 to 28 months for biomasses and biogas,(vi) 16 months for sustainable biofuels,(vii) 36 months for tides and waves.A 12 months delay is allowed before losing the registration, but a 0.5% penalty for each month of delay applies on the applicable tariff. After losing the admission, a new successful application leads in any case to a tariff reduced by 15% on the applicable level. The following plants can access the tariffs directly upon entry into operation:(i) wind and oceanic streams with capacity not exceeding 60 kW,(ii) hydro streams with capacity not exceeding 50 kW,(iii) hydro streams with capacity not exceeding 250 kW, where built on existing channels and pipes without increase of the flux, that use returned waters or waste water, that use the minimal flow of dams excluding the climb-up volumes,(iv) biomasses streams with capacity not exceeding 200 kW,(v) biogas streams with capacity not exceeding 100 kW,(vi) repowered plants that fall within the above categories,(vii) re-built plants that fall within the above categories,(viii) plants subject to public tenders called by public entities that plants that fall within the above categories,(ix) plants for the conversion of the sugar industry, and(x) geothermal with medium and high enthalpy with re-injection up to 5 MW.Existing plants getting green certificates will be paid with the new tariffs: they will receive a tariff of 78% of the target regulated price of green certificates.For plants with capacity up to 1 MW the incentive is a feed-in tariff (it is paid on the electricity sold to GSE), but the owner of the plant can request the regime of the bigger plants. For plants with capacity exceeding 1 MW the incentive is in the form of a feed-in premium (it is paid on the electricity generated which is not to GSE). The decree provides for specific rules for the quantification of the tariff for rebuilt, reactivated, refitted and repowered plants.There is a number of specific bans to be granted with the tariff of the decree and other incentive systems currently implemented.","https://www.iea.org/policies/5211-feed-in-premium-for-renewable-energy-sources-other-than-photovoltaic",2012,NA,NA,"IEA"

"3073",4815,4815,"Austria","AUT",NA,"Green Electricity Act","The Green Electricity Act, which entered into force on the 1st of January 2003, made way for a uniform country wide regulation of the support schemes for Green Power. The Green Electricity Act is aimed at: - A single federal support payment scheme for ""other"" green power, small hydro and combined heat and power (CHP) was introduced; - A uniform feed-in tariff scheme was introduced for all eligible renewable energy sources; - The minimum target contribution from small hydro in 2008 was raised from 8 % to 9 % of total supply; - The minimum target contribution from ""other"" green power in 2008 was set at 4 %; - Increasing the share of ""green"" power from 70% (status in 1997) to the indicative target of 78.1% in 2010 in accordance with Directive 2001/77/EC; - The targets for ""other"" green power and small hydro relate to Austria as a whole; - Uniform feed-in tariffs and surcharges (support contributions) were introduced for the whole of Austria. In the case of small hydro power this resulted in a changeover from a certificate to a feed-in tariff system on 1 January 2003. Other changes include: - The certificate system for small-scale hydroelectric power stations expires at the end of 2002. - As of 1 January 2003, there will no longer be a quota obligation for the network operators and therefore also no more compensation payments as of this date. - All operators of green plants have the right to a listing of the certification of origin by the network operators. - The electricity identification system, which regulates the identification of the source of energy used to generate the electricity on bills, will be standardised after a transitional period up to 1 July 2004 and then all electricity dealers must identify a standard composition on all their end consumer bills (""standard dealer mix""). Large parts of the Green Electricity Act (GEA) are designed to support the production of green electricity via a feed-in tariff, which is financed by the Austrian electricity consumers through a clearance mechanism. The 2006 amendment to the GEA created a designated settlement centre, the OeMAG Abwicklungsstelle f<U+00FC>r <U+00D6>kostrom (OeMAG), which pays a feed-in tariff to the producers of green electricity. Electricity distributors are then obliged to purchase a certain amount of green electricity from OeMAG at a fixed price, which is lower than the feed-in tariff. This price is set by the Energy Control Commission through Regulations. The difference between the feed-in tariff and the purchase price for electricity distributors are borne by Austrian electricity consumers, who pay a fixed lump sum to OeMAG (""Z<U+00E4>hlpunktpauschale""), which varies according to the grid level on which they are connected to the network. The OeMAG has a maximum annual budget to purchase renewable electricity (EUR 17 million/year from 2007-11). The feed-in tariff rate is determined by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Environment and Water Management, as well as the L<U+00E4>nder (Feed-in Tariff Order, FLG II No. 508/2002 of December 2002). Amendments to the Act in 2006 mean that after conclusion of the contract, the green power plant has to be put into operation within 24 months, after this time limit feed-in tariffs can be claimed, namely tariffs valid at the date on which the contract with OeMAG was concluded: From the beginning of operation for the duration of 10 years; in the 11th year 75% respectively in the 12th year 50% of these tariffs will be compensated, at least the market price according to <U+00A7> 20 of the Green Electricity Act. 13th till 24th year: Purchase guarantee to the market tariff according to <U+00A7> 20 of the Green Electricity Act minus expenses for control energy (separate depending on wind energy or other energy sources).

"3086",4864,4864,"United Kingdom","GBR",NA,"Energy White Paper 2011","The UK White Paper presents the overall reform of the UK electricity system,aiming at designing a smart, flexible and responsive electricity system that provides for secure, low-carbon and affordable electricity supply. The UK power system needs to tackle 5 main challenges, namely:- Supply security, as old and polluting generation plants are bound to close (20GW by 2020) and as the system needs to adapt to higher levels of intermittent (wind) and inflexible generation (nuclear).- The need for electricity mix decarbonisation to reach 2020 RE targets -15% of primary energy needs from RE.- The increase in generation capacity to meet rising demand (transport sector electrification needs) in parallel with energy savings and efficiency practices.- Great need for cost-efficient investments to avoid high increases in cost of electricity, considering that carbon price and environmental policies are likely to lead to higher bills in the future.The government has identified several key tools, central to the reform strategy, that would allow for the transition to a decarbonised energy system to happen, namely:- The Feed in tariffs with Contract for Difference, expected to start by 2014, will provide a clear, stable and predictable revenue stream for investors. None of the tariff adjustments are retroactive.-<U+00A0>The Carbon Price Floor, expected to be in force by 2013, would guarantee a fair price on carbon and provide a stronger incentive to encourage investment in low carbon generation.- The Emission Performance Standard (EPS) expected to be in force by 2013, equivalent to 450g CO2/kWh at baseload, to limit the amount of carbon new fossil-fuel power plants can emit.Engaging with energy consumers to reduce demand will also become a priority both in the electricity and the heating sectors, where the Green deal will help to reduce cost and carbon emissions in buildings, with smart electricity and gas meters. On the short term, the market design reform shall allow for a smooth transition and investments to continue. Therefore, the existing Renewables Obligation will continue for existing projects supported by the scheme (principle of no retrospective change) and new ones until March 31st 2017. Between 2011 and 2017 new renewable energy generators will have a one-off choice between Renewable obligation support of feed-in tariff. The reform will also be included in the devolution process at the national scale.","https://www.iea.org/policies/5123-energy-white-paper-2011",2011,NA,NA,"IEA"

The new Rule will cover approximately 85% of the country's GHG emissions and apply to approximately 10 000 facilities. The Rule will allow the collection of accurate and comprehensive emissions data which will be used to inform future policy decisions. The new reporting system will provide a better understanding of where GHGs are coming from and will guide development of the best possible policies and programmes to reduce emissions. The data will also allow businesses to track their own emissions, compare them to similar facilities, and provide assistance in identifying cost-effective ways to reduce emissions in the future. The first annual reports for the largest emitting facilities, covering calendar year 2010 (monitoring begins 1 January 2010), were to be submitted to EPA 31 March 2011.

This substitutes the existing antitrust ceilings introduced by Legislative Decree no. 164/2000 (which expired at the end of 2010), also identifying new measures for increasing competition in the natural gas market. The Decree provides that antitrust ceilings be calculated with reference to the market share of each operator, taking into account the amount of natural gas input into the national network, purchases in spot markets, and sales to importers in Italy made at national network entry points. Consequently, market shares will not be lower than the amount input to the network. Operators in the natural gas market will have to comply with a maximum share of 40% of domestic consumption. A mechanism of gas release at regulated prices is provided in case an operator fails to comply with the mandatory ceilings on the market share. This ceiling can be raised to 55% in case an operator commits itself to building new storage capacity in Italy for a total of 4 bcm within five years. The decree introduces measures for increasing competition in the natural gas market aiming at transferring the ensuing benefits to final customers, increasing storage capacity, supporting the security of supplies and enhancing flexibility in the gas system. To achieve this target, compensation to municipalities interested by the construction of new storage fields has been provided. Furthermore, in 2011 AEEG is expected to publish a new regulation concerning economic compensation mechanisms in the natural gas market.","https://www.iea.org/policies/144-measures-for-increasing-competition-in-the-natural-gas-market-and-transferring-the-ensuing-benefits-to-final-customers",2010,NA,NA,"IEA"

Any entity that has a contract for purchasing electricity can be a producer of electricity from renewable energy sources, covering solar, wind, hydro, cogeneration, biomass, and fuel cells using hydrogen from renewable energy microproduction. Licensing is conducted through the internet, via the System of Registration of Microproducers (SRM), an electronic platform through with producers register their installations. Micro producers cannot inject more than 50 % of the power mentioned in the purchasing contract, limited to 3.68 kW, except in the case of installations for condominiums. There are two types of feed-in tariffs: General Regime - The tariff is equal to the cost of electricity sold under the purchasing contract Bonified Tariff - a special reference tariff is defined during the first 5 years following the installation. The reference tariff for the first 10 MW installed is defined as EUR 650/MWh and decreases 5 % for each additional 10 MW registered in the SRM. The reference tariff applies differently depending on the renewable energy technology used. It is 100% for solar (i.e., the full EUR 650/MWh), 70% for wind, 30% for hydro, cogeneration and biomass. For fuel cells, the tariff is the one that applies to the renewable energy source used for hydrogen production. As of October 2010, the Decree Law 118-A/2010 modifies some aspects of Microgeneration Law DL 363/2007 . This amendment intends to support the generation of electricity from renewable sources in Low voltage systems by simplifying the application procedure. The new regulation increases the annual ceiling for installation to 25 MW per year and streamlines the access to the Micro Production regime for public, social, education, defense and local institutions. Moreover, the Bonified Regime is adjusted to the cost of equipments used in the Micro production and can only be accesssed under certain conditions, namely the compliance with energy efficiency measures and the use of solar thermal collectors or biomass boilers.

This tariff will be decreased every year for new installations by 1%, as opposed to the previous 2%.The law also increases the<U+00A0>repowering bonus, to support the replacement of old turbines by new ones. The initial remuneration will be increased by EUR 0.5 cent/kWh. Turbines that are replaced must be located in the same administrative district and be at least ten years old. The new turbine needs to have at least twice, but no more than five times the original turbines capacity.For<U+00A0>offshore wind, the initial tariff is set at EUR cent 15 /kWh until 2015. After that it is set to<U+00A0>decrease<U+00A0>to EUR cent 13/kWh for new turbines, decreasing by 5% per year.The amendment is meant to reflect the increasing costs faced by wind turbine manufacturers, largely due to increases in the costs of raw materials such as steel and copper.Hydropower tariffs<U+00A0>have<U+00A0>increased, and differentiate between new and modernised facilities.For capacity up to 500kW, the tariff is EUR cents 12.67/kWh for new and EUR cents 11.67/kWh for modernised facilities.Between 500kW and 2MW the tariff for both facilities is EUR cents 8.65/kwh, andBetween 2 and 5MW it is EUR cents 7.65/kWh for new and EUR cents 8.65/kWh for modernised facilities.For facilities over 5MW, the tariff starts at EUR cents 7.29/kWh for the first 500kW of output, decreasing for increasing outputs in three steps to reach EUR cents 3.05/kWh for output over 50MW. These same tariffs apply for capacity added to existing facilities that have more than 5MW capacity.Biogas<U+00A0>facility tariff changes generally favour small plants.Tariffs for<U+00A0>landfill gas<U+00A0>facilities have<U+00A0>increased<U+00A0>for small plants up to 500kWel, to EUR cents 9/kWh from the previous 7.11.

Under the new EEG, the tariff of EUR cents 7.79/kWh for capacity over 5MW only applies if the electricity is produced using combined heat and power generation.In addition, the<U+00A0>CHP bonus<U+00A0>for electricity produced using biomass combined heat and power increased to EUR cents 3/kWh. The tariff and bonuses will decrease by 1% a year. In addition, biogas and biomass production that uses energy crops, waste biomass and manure are eligible for bonuses.Tariffs for<U+00A0>geothermal<U+00A0>facilities<U+00A0>increase<U+00A0>and are simplified into under and over 10MW capacity categories. For the former the rate is EUR cents 16/kWh, and for the latter EUR cents 10.5/kWh.New heat cogeneration bonuses were introduced, of EUR cents 3/kWh for a capacity of up to 10MWel, increasing to EUR cents 4/kWh if petrothermal technology is used. The tariff and bonuses decrease by 1% a year.For<U+00A0>solar PV, tariffs under the new law<U+00A0>decreased<U+00A0>for all capacity sizes.For roof-mounted facilities, these are EUR cents 43.01/kWh up to 30kW,40.91 from 30 to 100kW,39.58 from 100kW to 1MW,and 33 over 1MW.For free-standing facilities the tariff decreased to EUR cents 31.94/kWh.

Accordingly, in this context, the Cabinet of Ministers Ruling in hand set up an organised power plant commissioning calendar for the years to come; focusing on Wind and Solar Thermal Electric renewable energy technologies, and up to the end of 2012 and 2013 respectively. It establishes a power plant commissioning roadmap which allocates an annual average installed capacity slightly higher than 1,700 MW for wind power and 500 MW for solar thermal electric power. The Ruling intends to administer the amount of renewable energy installed so as to offer a sensible apportionment of consumer costs over the years, as well as to provide technical feasibility of renewable energy integration into the electrical grid. At the same time, it minimises uncertainty for the industry and investors, by providing a medium-term foreseeable future, which will assist all involved agents in their business and risk planning.

The plan does not include the construction of new hydropower facilities, but seeks to improve the efficiency and capacity of the countrys hydropower dams. The plan has three components. The first component involves the renewable process for the concessions of the 400 largest dams, to be attributed on a competitive basis. The candidates who wish to exploit the dams must: - Meet stringent security requirements; - Meet energy efficiency requirements to maximise their production potential; - Meet requirements as to water quality and the impact on the environment and ecosystems. The call for candidacies will take place in 2009, with the renewal process being complete by 2012. The second aspect of the plan calls for large-scale public investment in hydropower dams, in compliance with the commitments undertaken as part of the Grenelle de lEnvironnement. These investments have the following primary aims: -To improve production capacity through new generation turbines, allowing for 30% more production; - To develop pumping stations, ensuring steady supply during peak hours without having recourse to fuel-powered electricity production. - To develop small- and micro-hydropower, including the standardisation of wind turbines. Lastly, the plan will undertake measures to ensure high water quality in streams and rivers. All aspects of the plan are to be discussed with relevant stakeholders. The planned investments will be financed through an increase in the fees paid by hydroelectric concession operating companies, which will be proposed to the parliament.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4703-hydropower-revival-plan",2009,NA,NA,"IEA"

It set out the areas of greatest opportunity for businesses, and a programme to assist them in seizing such opportunities.  High-opportunity sectors are:  - Offshore wind;  - Civil nuclear power;  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS);  - Ultra-low carbon vehicles;  - Low-carbon buildings and construction;  - Low-carbon aerospace;  - Chemicals and industrial biotechnology;  - Low-carbon electronics and ICT (Information and Communication Technologies);  - Business and financial services; and  - Carbon markets.  The Strategy included specific support for certain low-carbon sectors, including low-carbon energy sources. Measures include up to GBP 120 million for the development of an offshore wind industry, GBP 60 million for a package of measures to accelerate wave and tidal energy development and deployment, and capital investment of GBP 15 million for a Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre to facilitate joint development and production of high quality nuclear components by around 30 companies.  Several funding initiatives also targeted electric vehicles, with GBP 230 million for consumer incentives to reduce the price of electric and plug-in hybrid cars from 2011, GBP 30 million for electric vehicle charging infrastructure development, and the establishment of a cross-Whitehall Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV).  In addition GBP 6 million in funding supported the construction of 60 or more low-carbon affordable homes, GBP 12 million allocated for a new open access demonstrator facility for fermentation of up to 10 tonnes for industrial biotechnologies, and a fund of GBP 2.5million over the next two years will support SMEs in using the facility.  The Manufacturing Advisory Service was expanded, with GBP 4 million in funding, to provide specialist advice to manufacturers on competing for low carbon opportunities, including support for suppliers for the civil nuclear industry. General priorities for low-carbon development included greater energy efficiency, smarter low-carbon procurement and the construction or retrofit of low carbon buildings.   A suite of measures to facilitate the commercialisation of low-carbon innovation and research were also outlined in the LCIS. Budget 2009 allocated additional funding of GBP 450 million to support low-carbon industries and advanced green manufacturing, GBP 50 million for the Technology Strategy Board, and GBP 90 million for detailed design and development work for the CCS demonstration competition. The UK Innovation Investment Fund was also been created, with an initial GBP 150 million of government investment. The Fund will address the financing gap occurring just before new technologies reach the marketplace. The government hopes the Fund will reach GBP 1 billion over the next ten years.

New measures to increase financial support for offshore wind will also be considered.Introducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities.New guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards. Before the schemes take effect, GBP 45 million in grants have been committed.The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will be amended or replaced, taking into account sustainability issues, to ensure transport fuels contain a rising amount of renewable biofuels.The Strategy also creates an Office for Renewable Energy Deployment (ORED) within the Department of Energy  &  Climate Change (DECC) to take forward the commitments outlined in the Strategy.In addition, the Strategy sets out areas for action in four areas.The first aims to improve planning processes to be swifter and more strategic.The second for measures to strengthen the UKs renewable energy industry, including through greater investment and work with the financial sector.The third targets improvements and investments in the electricity grid, including improved grid access, more strategic investments (including in an offshore grid and a smarter grid).Finally, the government outlines commitments for sustainable bioenergy development and use. This will act on the supply-side (woods management, energy crops, use of waste), focus on better sustainability criteria, and measures to facilitate use of biofuels and innovative bioenergy (for example, better fuel quality standards, injection of biogas into the grid, capacity of road and transport for greater biofuel use).The Strategy also commits to using part of GBP 405 million of funding for key emerging technologies for renewable energy technologies, such as wave and tidal generation, offshore wind, and advanced biofuels. The government estimates that the Strategy will provide cumulative savings of 755 MtCO2 between now and 2030, 535 MtCO2 of which will help the UK meet EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) caps, and 220 MtCO2 will provide additional CO2 reductions.

The draft Regulations provide for inter alia: - A 40% improvement in energy efficiency for new homes in 2008. - A 40% reduction in CO2 emissions. - A mandatory minimum renewable energy requirement in all new homes, such as solar heating systems or biomass systems eg(wood pellet). - Mandatory levels of energy efficient fixed light fittings - Minimum standards on heating systems to ensure they are highly energy efficient (oil and gas fired boilers must meet minimum seasonal net efficiency of 86% both new buildings; this is to be met where practicable in existing buildings, as of 31 March 2008) - Minimum requirements for heating system controls to minimise energy waste through excessive heating - Air tightness testing, to ensure the homes are not leaking heat excessively. - Guidance on ensuring a minimum quality of workmanship and construction - Consumer information on the efficient operation of the homeowners dwelling as a minimum requirement. - Commitment in the guidelines to review and improve regulations to 60 per cent in 2010 with the ultimate aim of achieving a zero carbon standard for new houses in the medium to long term. - New buildings should also be future-proofed to be easily upgraded to higher energy and CO2 standards in the future The regulations were further amended in the course of 2008, with provisions for them to apply to existing buildings extended. A new methodology to measure the energy demand and CO2 emissions of new non-residential buildings was also introduced, the Non-domestic Energy Assessment Procedure (NEAP). New non-residential buildings msut also meet the requirements set out in section L1 of the building code.

These are to be reached via linear phasing, with concrete measures set for meeting the targets.  By 2011, 20% of gross energy consumption must come from renewable energy sources.The agreement includes better terms for wind turbines and other sustainable energy sources such as biomass and bio gas.Aside from significantly raising the transfer rate for electricity from land wind turbines, biomass and bio gas, the parties agree to install 400 MW from new offshore wind turbines by 2012. Plans to invest in two new 75 MW land-based facilities in 2010 and 2011 have also been announced.The deal also provides  incentives and a compensation scheme for local residents to allow land-based wind farms  to be located in their area, including a new stakeholder model.In addition, 25 million DKK per year for the next five years has been earmarked for wave and solar power  research.The effort to save energy is being considerably ramped up:  The new agreement commits Denmark to cut its energy consumption by 2% by 2012, compared with 2006 levels.  This is half a percentage point more than Denmarks current target, meaning that in 2020, energy use must have fallen by 4% compared to 2006.Hydrogen vehicles are to be tax-free  and the same applies to electric vehicles provisionally until 2012, and a pool of 35 million DKK is being set aside for electric vehicle research. The government and Danish Peoples Party would like a significant increase in research, development and demonstration efforts in energy technology to the amount of 750 million DKK in 2009 and 1 billion DKK from 2010, and this will be taken up in connection with the implementation of globalisation funding.In the case of significant deviations for the linear phasing of renewable energy and energy savings targets, the parties (Danish government and parliament) shall discuss supplementary initiatives for attaining the targets.The parties behind the agreement will receive a status report on development toward the goals and implement analyses up until 2011. By the end of 2010 it will be determined whether there is a need for implementing further initiatives.","https://www.iea.org/policies/54-danish-energy-agreement-for-2008-2011",2008,NA,NA,"IEA"

While generally requiring separation of monopoly electricity lines and competitive generation and retailing business, the amendment creates more favourable conditions for electricity generation using renewable energy resources. The amendment seeks to encourage lines companies to invest in permitted generation, particularly renewable generation. While electric lines companies are already able to own some types of renewable generation in unlimited quantities, the new legislation widens the definition of renewables to encompass geothermal, wind, hydro and others. This is intended to facilitate investment by local lines companies in some of the smaller projects that are not of interest to the larger generators. A line company can also sell the results of renewable energy generation in any region outside of its lines area, without restriction. It need not comply with the arms length separation rules provided that the generation is not connected to its lines. In addition a lines company may invest in ""new"" (ie. generation commissioned after 8 August 2001) renewable generation which is connected to its lines, of any size. This renewable generation does not count towards the lines companys connected generation cap. This also applies to generators that are partly renewable and partly fossil fuel based, provided that fossil fuels provide no more than 20% of the fuel for the generator in any 12 month period. The lines company may sell this electricity to the customers within its lines area. The amendment to the EIRA is intended to contribute to New Zealands target of generating 90% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4722-electricity-industry-reform-act-amendment",2008,NA,NA,"IEA"

Therefore, climate and energy policy have become closely entwined in the past few years. The Finnish Government has submitted a report to Parliament on climate and energy policy in 2001 and 2005. Since the latest report, international and EU climate and energy political objectives and obligations have changed to such an extent that, in 2007, a policy position was set down in the Government Programme of Prime Minister Vanhanens second Cabinet, stating that the Government would draw up a long-term climate and energy strategy at the beginning of its current term, to define the principal objectives and means of Finlands climate and energy policy for the next few decades, within the context of the European Union and its objectives. It was decided that the Strategy would be submitted to Parliament in the form of a report. The report was prepared under the steering of the Governments Ministerial Working Group on Climate and Energy Policy. The preparatory body for the Ministerial Working Group has been the Climate and Energy Policy Network, comprising representatives of several ministries, including the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Education, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Prime Ministers Office, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of the Environment. The report consists of an outline and strategy texts, including background information, and four appendices. On the other hand, the strategy proper describes the changes that have taken place in the international operating environment, and presents the Governments outlines for energy and climate policy in the forthcoming years, alongside proposals for key measures for the attainment of the EUs objectives regarding the promotion of renewable energy, the enhancement of efficiency in energy consumption, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The strategy sets targets for final energy consumption and electricity consumption in 2020, aiming to keep them relatively stable as compared to current (2008) levels. Final energy consumption is to reach 310 TWh (almost equal to the current level) and electricity consumption is to reach 98 TWh (slightly higher than the 2008 level of just under 90 TWh). The strategy presents two scenarios: the baseline in compliance with current measures and development, and the objective, meeting the EUs and national objectives. According to the scenarios, for 2020, electricity consumption would, at the baseline, be 103 TWh (terawatt-hours), primary energy consumption 479 TWh, final energy consumption 347 TWh and greenhouse gas emissions 89 Mt CO2-eqv. (million equivalent carbon dioxide tonnes) and corresponding emissions outside the emission trading sector, 36 Mt CO2-eqv. According to the objective, in 2020, electricity consumption will equal 98 TWh, primary energy consumption 430 TWh, final energy consumption 310 TWh and emissions outside the emission trading sector 30 Mt CO2-eqv. Emissions within industries included in emission trading are specified in accordance with EU-wide emission trading, which is under modification. The strategy aims for a marked increase in the share of indigenously generated energy, as well as improved energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy. The share of renewable energy is targeted to increase to 38% of total final energy consumption. This will require an increase in the use of wood-based energy, waste fuels, heat pumps, biogas and wind energy. The use of forest chips is to be increased by two or three times over current levels, and by 2020, some 6TWh of wind energy to be harnessed for use, which would entail the construction of a minimum of 700 new 3 MW wind power plants.

The programme invites proposals for housing developments incorporating design and technology features that lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions from energy use in a typical new home by at least 70% relative to a reference dwelling built to baseline Building Regulations 2005 standards. The developments covered by the programme will combine heat and electricity demand reduction, efficient low-carbon heat supply, and efficient low-carbon electricity auto-generation. The minimum requirements are that development proposals reach the following targets: - A building energy rating (BER) of A2 or better; - Achieve an energy performance coefficient (EPC) less than 0.25 (below the current Building Regulations figure of 0.6); - Achieve a carbon dioxide performance coefficient (CPC) less than 0.30 (below the current Building Regulations figure of 0.69); - Generate electricity onsite (for supply or export) per unit to the equivalent of 10 kWh/m2 per year or greater (primary energy). Specific requirements include 14 different aspects: 1) Onsite electrical generation: Microgeneration technologies and large-scale solutions are both supported, both renewable and CHP. Use of smart meters is also important. 2) Passive design strategy: To minimise energy demand, particularly through passive heating, ventilation and daylighting design and technology features. 3) Site layout and house design: Should reduce site exposure using natural shelter and landscaping and to maximise solar gain. 4 & 5) Ventilation and structural sealing: To minimise heat loss and ensure good air quality. 6) Insulation of the building envelope: U-value specifications must exceed those of the 2007 Building Regulations. Indicative acceptable reference values in W/m2K are provided as follows: Doors less than or equal to 2.2; Windows less than or equal to1.8; Walls less than or equal to 0.22; Floors less than or equal to 0.20; Roofs less than or equal to 0.13. 7) Thermal bridging: To avoid excessive heat loss and local condensation. 8 & 9) Lighting and appliances: Incorporation of low-energy light fittings; all appliances provided by the developer must meet the highest energy efficiency rating for that product type (A+). 10) Principal auxiliary heating systems: Using central heating condensing oil, gas boilers (must be high efficiency, can incorporate solar panels) or wood pellet boilers, solar space heating, heat pump, group or community heating system. 11) Secondary heating systems: Must present standard of efficiency higher than prevailing practice. 12) Building materials: Must be sustainable, for example CFC and HCFC free, include recycled content, low toxicity or low embodied energy materials. 13) Water: Water economy measures must be undertaken where practicable. 14) Information and advice: The developer must commit to providing homeowners with appropriate information and advice on operating energy-saving features and appliances. The preferred scale of projects is between 5 and 15 units, though one-off houses are not precluded. Indicative funding is that up to 40% of eligible expenditure, up to a maximum of EUR 15 000 per unit will be provided. The level of support will be dependent on various factors, such as the level of innovation proposed, the performance improvement achieved (in terms of energy and CO2 reductions), and in certain cases the typical floor area of the dwellings in the development.","https://www.iea.org/policies/1360-low-carbon-homes-programme",2008,NA,NA,"IEA"

RGGI is composed of individual CO2 Budget Trading Programs in each of the ten participating states. These ten programmes are implemented through state regulations, based on a RGGI Model Rule, and are linked through CO2 allowance reciprocity.

The Act was enacted in 1979 in the light of the oil shock. This comprehensive act covers all sectors as follows: Energy management in manufacturing, commercial and transportation sectors; energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances (Top Runner Program); energy efficiency standards for houses and buildings. In 2008 the act was revised to strengthen measures to enhance energy efficiency, including those for the commercial sector. Also in this revision, sectoral approaches used in domestic regulation was introduced, to be implemented as of April 2009. a) Regulatory Expansion in the Commercial Sector Before the revision, only large scale factories and workplaces were targeted to enforce the energy management. The revision expanded this site-specific requirement to a company-wide one; a company consuming above a certain amount of energy must implement energy efficiency measures for all of its factories and workplaces. This also expands coverage beyond manufacturing sites, to offices and franchise companies running convenience stores. A new regulation was also added, requiring that a board member be appointed to be in charge of energy management for the whole company. b) Sectoral Approaches as National Regulation (Sectoral Benchmarking) Sectoral approaches have for the first time been introduced as a domestic regulatory measure. Sectoral benchmarks are being established for certain sub-sectors, initially in energy intensive industries. Indicators are established for companies to benchmark their energy efficiency level against others within the same sub-sector, and medium- and long-term targets are set (to be achieved around 2015-2020). Currently, each factory and workplace is required to achieve annually on average 1 % reduction or more in energy intensity. The revision adds benchmarking indicators and associated targets to the above in certain sub-sectors: iron and steel, cement, and electricity suppliers. Targets are set at the energy efficiency level of the best performing companies (top 10%-20%) in each sub-sector based on the average value and standard deviation. Companies covered by the scheme must submit yearly reports on the status of the benchmarking indicator, in addition to the ratio of energy intensity reduction and on the implementation of an energy management system. Based on the companies reports, the government may take necessary measures when it sees substantial lack of efforts in reference to the targets. The measures include guidance, publication of the companys name, and order (with a fine imposed when the company does not adhere to the order). The indicators average value and standard deviation for each sub-sector will also be published by the government based on company reports.

In order to meet this target, the reform and continuation of the MEP schemes was decided. The two previous schemes were combined into a new scheme called SDE (stimulering duurzame energie). In August 2007 the Dutch government submitted the scheme for approval under EC Treaty state aid rules. In December the European Commission auhorised the aid scheme, to stimulate production of renewable energy and Combined Heat and Power. The extra available budget for the SDE is estimated at EUR 2,144 million. Unlike the MEP, the SDE is fully financed by direct government support. The regulation was published on 3 March 2008, and subsidy requests can be submitted as of 1 April 2008 from SenterNovem, the Ministry of Economic Affairs agency. Differences from the MEP are that projects are selected through tendering, and that the subsidy amounts will be corrected and vary depending on fossil fuel energy prices. Also, hydro projects are not eligible, though the scheme applies also to biogas. The scheme can be called a ""modified feed-in tariff""; a fixed subsidy is guaranteed, as in a feed-in tariff, with an option for a higher price per kWh if the electricity price goes above the subsidy ceiling. Thus, renewable energy producers are provided a fixed price per kWh. The scheme acts as a premium if the electricity price goes below the feed-in tariff. However, if the market electricity price is at or above the feed-in tariff price, no subsidy is received from the government. For example, the estimated subsidy amount in 2008 for sewage-gas and waste water electricity, as well as high efficiency waste generation is zero, since the wholesale market price is expected to be higher than the estimated cost of production from these technologies. Offshore wind is not eligible for subsidies in 2008 and 2009; the first tender will be in 2010. In addition, annual expenditures are capped by technology. Estimated yearly caps are calculated based on capacity installed and estimated installations from 2008 to 2011. These are: EUR 1 million for biogas from sewage and waste water; EUR 19 million for small-scale PV (0.6 kWp-3.5 kWp); EUR 68 million for biomass CHP, co-digestion of food industry waste and manure; EUR 119 million for off-shore wind; EUR 129 million for on-shore wind.

This royal decree supersedes Royal Decree 436/2004 of March 2004, establishing new tariffs and premiums for each kind of facility covered and incorporating renewable energy, waste to energy, hybrid systems and cogeneration plants into the special regime.The cost of the regime is borne by the grid operator, who can pass on costs to consumers.The grid operators costs are balanced monthly, and where there is a deficit this is covered by the National Energy Committee (CNE).The new scheme generally applies to all technologies, with technology-specific and capacity-specific limits, as well as a combined feed-in tariff and feed-in premium scheme. Facilities with high system efficiency, or that use reactive energy, receive a bonus. Renewable energy facilities are covered by the special regime only if their installed capacity does not exceed 100 MW (50 MW for hydro facilities). Up to 50MW, operators can choose between receiving a feed-in tariff price, or a feed-in premium paid on top of the market electricity price. The feed-in tariffs are paid during the entire time of a systems operation, though these are reduced after a specified number of years. This period is 25 years PV, ocean and hydro systems, 20 years for wind and geothermal, and 15 years for biomass systems. Between 50 and 100MW, operators receive a bonus amount for the electricity produced. Solar PV systems are exempt from this arrangement; they receive guaranteed feed-in tariffs which are adjusted every quarter for new systems.In September 2008, new tariffs and a new cap were established for solar PV. Systems registered prior to 29 September 2008 are eligible for a feed-in tariff of between approximately EUR cents 23/kWh and EUR cents 44/kWh (depending on system size). The installation cap of 371MW established by the law has been adjusted upwards to 500MW as of 2009, while the feed-in tariff has been reduced to EUR cents 32/kWh for ground systems and EUR cents 34/kWh for rooftop systems. A registry of systems eligible to receive the new tariffs has been established as of January 2009.Guarantees for processing new applications: The decree provides that those requesting new production facilities in the special regime must present a guarantee for an amount equivalent to EUR 500/kW for the photovoltaic facilities or EUR 20/kW for all other facilities. Facilities holding a certificate for the definitive start-up of service before 1 January 2008 that opt to transfer, before 1 January 2009, electricity to the system in return for a regulated tariff will continue to be covered by Royal Decree 436/2004 for the lifetime of that facility.Facilities holding a certificate for the definitive start up of service before 1 January 2008 that opt to sell, before 1 January 2009, energy on the market will also continue to be covered by Royal Decree 436/2004 - until 31 December 2012.

In terms of Clean Energy, various objectives and measures are outlined, through four lines of action for energy efficiency, renewable energy, demand management, and research development and innovation. All of these call for the creation of new financing mechanisms. In energy efficiency, the strategy seeks to ensure efficiency improvements are beneficial overall, by removing fare structures that encourage consumption, and putting in place regulatory measures to prevent increased demand for energy should efficiency lead to reduced energy costs. Information campaigns, for both companies and consumers, will be undertaken, and voluntary commitments by companies encouraged. For Climate Change, specific action lines across 11 broad areas are outlined, which are: i) Institutional cooperation, ii) Flexible mechanisms, iii) International Cooperation and cooperation with developing countries, iv) Emission Trading, v) Sinks, vi) CO2 Capture and Storage, vii) Sectors concerned with diffuse pollution, viii) Adaptation to climate change , ix) Information and public awareness, x) Research, development and technological innovation and xi) Horizontal Measures. Within these, 198 specific measures are detailed, which in turn provide for the 75 indicators the government will use to measure progress. A variety of measures to make the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme more effective are put forward, aiming at greater harmonisation and stability, an expansion of the scheme to other gas and/or sectors, and connection of registries. Measures are also planned for CCS, including a scoping study and analysis, the design of a suitable legal framework, and the monitoring and co-ordination of various CCS initiatives across the country. Sectors concerned with diffuse pollution are those which do not fall under the GHG emissions trading scheme, namely transport, waste, residential, commercial and institutional sectors, farming and fluorinated gases. Regarding the latter, Spain will transpose EU Regulation 842/2006 and EU Directive 2006/40/EC to establish limits and controls on certain fluorinated gas emissions. In transport, various measures target better infrastructure and territorial planning and modal change. In addition, the use of efficient building and power generation technologies, as well as renewable energy sources, are to be used when developing transport facilities. Other efficiency measures include eco-driving programmes, improved energy labels for vehicles, as well as integration of energy efficiency criteria in administrative contracts to increase the number of clean-air vehicles in the public vehicle fleet. In the residential, commercial and institutional sectors, most measures will concentrate on buildings; both new buildings, through strengthening thermal building code requirements and promoting energy performance certificates, as well as existing buildings, through incentives for renovation. Measures will also encourage the use of efficient appliances, heating equipment and light bulb. Measures targeting large energy consumers and SMEs are also envisaged. Regarding renewable energy, measures will extend the use of solar thermal panels in new housing projects as well as non-residential buildings and public facilities. In addition, the use of wood as heating fuel will be promoted. High priority support will be given to biomethanisation and the recovery of biogas from landfills.

It also seeks to promote, by granting priority to the generation of electrical power from RES and high efficiency cogeneration of electricity and heat plants in the internal electricity market. In the act, RES are listed as: wind energy, solar energy, wave energy, tidal energy, biomass, gases released in sanitary landfills and biological treatment plants, biogases, geothermal energy, and hydraulic energy utilized in hydroelectric stations. The act: - regulates the production of electricity using RES and high efficiency cogeneration; - regulates the installation and operation of power generation facilities using RES and high efficiency cogeneration - provides for the levels of feed in tariffs for electricity sourced for renewable energy; - provides for the promotion of power production from photovoltaic stations via the establishment of a photo-voltatic deployment programme; - establishes the institutional framework for the promotion of RES and high effciency cogeneration, including the publication of a national report on the topic, under the authority of the Minister of Development. Article 13 of the act provides for the feed-in tariffs listed below (to be priced monthly on the basis of the price in Euro per MWh of electricity taken up by the System or the Network). In each case, the first figure listed is the price for the interconnected system, while the second figure is the price for the non-interconnected islands. (a) wind energy: 73, 84.6 (b) wind energy from sea wind farms: 90 (c) hydraulic energy exploited in small-scale hydroelectric plants with an installed capacity up to 15 MWe: 73, 84.6 (d) Solar energy utilized in photovoltaic units with an installed capacity less than, or equal to 100 kW peak, and which will be installed in a lawfully owned or possessed property or in adjacent properties of the same owner or lawful possessor: 450, 500 (e) Solar energy exploited in photovoltaic units with an installed capacity of over 100 kW peak: 400, 450 (f) Solar energy exploited in units employing a technology other than that of photovoltaics with an installed capacity up to 5 MWe: 250, 270 (g) Solar energy exploited in units employing a technology other than that of photovoltaics with an installed capacity of over 5 MWe: 230, 250 (h) Geothermal energy, biomass, gases released from sanitary landfills and biological treatment plants and biogases: 73, 84.6 (i) Miscellaneous RES: 73, 84.6 (j) High-efficiency cogeneration of heat and electricity: 73, 84.6 In addition, the 9% VAT is not included. A 40% grant is available on top of the new feed-in tariffs for most of the systems (minimum investment eligible for grant = EUR100 000) In January 2009 amendments were made to the law, according to which feed-in tariffs will be unchanged until 2010. No more new applications for permits will be accepted, and all applications already filed for systems over 3Gwp will be finalised by the end of 2009. A separate program for rooftop PV will be introduced later in 2009, aiming at 750 extra MWp. Rooftop systems will receive a higher tariff for 20 years but no grant.

The TBC applies to new construction, except for technically simple structures of negligible constructional consequence not designated for residential or public use.The TBC also applies to the extension, modification, alteration or renovation works that are carried out on existing buildings. The Technical Code includes a set of Basic Documents, BD, for complying with the its basic requirements. These documents are to be updated in accordance with technical advancements and social requirements, and shall be approved regularly. Among the various BD is the Basic Energy Saving Document, which aims to obtain a rational use of energy required for buildings, reducing their consumption to sustainable limits, and ensuring that part of this consumption comes from renewable sources of energy, thanks to their design, construction, use and maintenance characteristics. This Basic Document comprises the following sections: HE.1: Limiting energy demand (heating and air conditioning). HE.2: Efficiency of heating/air-conditioning systems. HE.3: Energy efficiency of lighting systems. HE.4: Minimum solar contribution to the hot water supply. HE.5: Minimum photovoltaic contribution to the electrical power supply. The TBE contributes to the transposition of the Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings, in terms of the minimum energy requirements that must be met.   In order to comply with the Directive 2010/31/UE on energy efficiency in buildings, amending Directive 2002/91/EC, with regard to the energy efficiency requirements in buildings, the CTE DB-HE Basic Document on energy saving has been updated through the approval of the Order FOM/1635/2013 . This involves an increase in energy efficiency and renewable energies different from the ones mentioned in the above Basic Document, and also introduces a new section: HE.0: limitation of energy consumption. The energy consumption for the fitting-out, if applicable, of buildings or parts of them which, given that they are permanently open for reason of their use, will exclusively be met with energy coming from renewable energies. These demands shall be checked using a calculation procedure pursuant to the specifications established to the purpose.

It was meant for photovoltaic plants connected to the grid with a nominal capacity higher than 1 kWp realized by natural and legal persons, condominiums and public bodies. The decree provided a set of tariffs, valid for a period of 20 years, with a bonus in case of high degree of PV integration in the buildings. Three types of systems were considered: not integrated, partially integrated and fully integrated. For 2010 the premiums ranged from a minimum of EUR 0.346/kWh (for not integrated plants with P>20 kW) to a maximum of EUR 0.471/kWh (for fully integrated plants with plants a capacity 1=P=3). A tariff bonus of 5% was provided to self-producers, public schools and public hospitals, installations integrated to building substituting asbestos roofs, municipalities with less than 5 000 inhabitants. Plants with a capacity lower than 20 kWp could further benefit from on the on-spot trading service. Furthermore, this feed-in premium scheme promoted energy efficiency measures in buildings providing an additional bonus in case energy efficiency interventions in the buildings were implemented; on the basis of the energy saving level achieved, it was possible to obtain a maximum increase of the 30% of the base tariff. Producers got, in addition to the premium, the price of the electricity sold either on the market or through bilateral contracts. The feed-in premium scheme for PV plants was again revised by the Ministerial Decree of 6 August 2010. It incentivizes PV plants commissioned after December 31st, 2010, connected to the grid and with a nominal capacity higher than 1 kWp. Natural and legal persons, owners of housing units and/or buildings and public bodies could apply the support scheme. The 2010 decree provided a set of tariffs, valid for a period of 20 years, granted to the following power plants: - Installations on buildings, other PV plants, integrated PV plants with innovative characteristics (i.e. plants that use special components and modules, developed specifically to replace architectural elements); concentrating photovoltaic system; photovoltaic plants with technological innovation (i.e. the one that uses modules and components which are characterized by significant technological innovations). The decree also provides, in addition to a national target for PV power installed by 2020 of 8, 000MW, a power limit for each power plant category that can be incentivized: - 3, 000 MW for photovoltaic plants; - 300 MW for Photovoltaic plants which are architecturally integrated with innovative characteristics; - 200 MW Concentrating photovoltaic system. The provisions set by this last ministerial decree applied to PV plants commissioned until 31.5.2011 as according to the provisions of the Legislative decree No.28/2011. The Ministerial Decree of May 5th, 2011 sets out provisions for promoting PV plants with a capacity = 1 kW and commissioned between June 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2016. It also establishes a 23,000 MW cap for the national capacity installed which corresponds to an indicative cumulative annual cost of 6-7 billions of euros. Once achieved one of these minimum values set either for the national capacity cap or for the cumulative annual cost, a further Ministerial Decree will be issued to revise the PV support scheme. The decree establishes a set of tariffs differentiated by capacity and category of PV plants, distinguishing between PV on building and ""other"" PV plants. It also provides specific premiums to incentivize the use of photovoltaic modules that use non-conventional and special components, developed specifically to complement architectural elements and replace the buildings, in PV plants with a capacity = 1 kW and = 5 MW. May apply to such tariffs natural and legal persons, public entities and owners of houses and/or buildings. Furthermore, the Ministerial Decree introduces a feed-in premium scheme to incentivize Concentrating PV systems. Only legal persons and public entities may apply to such specific tariffs. All the tariffs set by the ministerial decree are granted to electricity produced as a bonus on top of the electricity selling price. As of 1.1.2013, the tariffs will be granted to the electricity injected into the grid modifying the previous feed-in premium scheme in a feed-in tariff scheme.

The Plan presents the energy targets set for each area of renewable energy technology, the measures necessary to meet those targets - including financing - and the lines of technological innovation and the benefits deriving from their application. The Plan aims to maintain the governments commitment to meet at least 12% of total energy use from renewable sources by 2010, while incorporating other indicative targets - 29.4% of electricity generated from renewable sources and 5.75% (more accurately 5.83%) of transport fuel needs to be met from biofuels by 2010 - adopted after the previous Plan came into effect. Certain details on specific provisions are indicated below. Wind: As planned, wind energy would generate up to 20,155 MW by 2010. This was an increase on the previous target of from 13,000 MW by 2010. To encourage this growth from present capacity, the plan noted the importance of grid access for renewables and ameliorating the transmission systems management. Solar: The plan provided for 4-5 million square metres of solar generating capacity by 2010. It also promoted the use of photovoltaic collectors in buildings through public subsidies from local and central agencies, with official backing for solar installations. The objective for solar power installations was increased to 400 MW by 2010, compared with the previous objective of 144 MW. In October 2007, the government announced a further increase of this target - namely 1,200MW of installation capacity by 2010. In making the announcement, the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce announced that figures from the Comisi<U+00F3>n Nacional de la Energ<U+00ED>a showed that 85% of the original quota had been met, and that the full 400MW was likely to be installed by the end of 2007. The plan also aims to have 500 MW of thermoelectric solar power generation capacity by 2010. Biomass: As established in the PER, biomass-generated electricity should total 2,000 MW per year by 2010: 3568 Ktoe, including a target of 1552 Ktoe from co-firing. To complement the PER in achieving this target, the Spanish government passed Law 24/2005 in November 2005 to favor biomass over traditional power sources. Biofuels: The Spanish government also raised its target for the production of bio-ethanol and bio-diesel to 2.2 million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) by 2010, from an initial 0.5 million toe. The plan also provided for EUR 2.855 to promote biofuels through fiscal incentives. The Plan set common standards for the administrative processes of Spains autonomous regions and established a single office to oversee renewables and cogeneration operations. The plan is indicative, meaning that it is not binding upon the actors in the energy system. Funds for feed-in tariffs comprise EUR 4.956 billion of the total budget. The energy industry is expected to finance 77% of the overall cost of the renewable energy plan, and other private sector industries another 20% and the government, the remainder. Tax incentives will also be offered.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4431-renewable-energy-plan-2005-2010",2005,NA,NA,"IEA"

In addition, the Decree introduces various measures, such as a simplified permit procedure to build power plants, an asking the Regulator to favour the grid connection process. To assess the exploitable energy potential from biomass, an ad-hoc experts committee has been created to help design appropriate legislation. The Decree provides also the adoption of legislation and criteria (minimum requirements, possibility to accumulate incentives, preferential tariffs, capacity targets, use of green certificates) for granting incentives to power produced from solar energy. The Decree includes specific provisions which favour biomass and hybrid plants (i.e., those producing part of their power from renewables) over fossil fuel plants in dispatching. A five-year programme agreement between the MSE and ENEA on RD&D measures to support renewables and energy efficiency has been established. Regional targets for renewable-based electricity are encouraged and regional governments can establish their own plans for renewables support. Specific articles address the issue of guarantee of origin for electricity produced from renewables, which can be requested for plants producing more than 100 MWh per year from GSE. Conditions under which the electricity produced can be sold in the power market or purchased by GSE are indicated. Specific rules are set for the streamlining of authorisation procedures for plants and infrastructure devoted to power production from renewables.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4032-res-promotion-decree-implementing-directive-200177ec",2004,NA,NA,"IEA"

The law raises the cap on total photovoltaic capacity that is eligible for premium payments under the renewable energy law, and extends mineral oil tax exemption to cover all biomass fuels. This law is accepted under reserve of the EU. On the photovoltaic front, the Renewable Energy Law, EEG (erneuerbare Energiegesetz), passed in April 2000, stated that only electricity from the first 350MW of photovoltaic plant capacity installed was eligible for premium payments. The feed-in tariff was originally EUR Cent 50.5/kWh (99Pf/kWh) but is now EUR Cent 45,7/kWh due to an automatic annual -5% ratchet built into the law. The reform raises this cap to 1,000MW. The new law benefits biofuels by exempting them from oil tax until the end of 2008. The law requires that the federal finance ministry draw up a report with the aid of other relevant ministries every two years, with the first due at the end of March 2004, to chart progress in the market introduction of biofuels, and to examine price developments of biomass, crude oil and automobile fuels. If deemed necessary, the ministry may recommend adjusting the size of the tax break for biofuels to fit the market situation. In the year 2006 the Mineral Oil Tax Law was replaced by the Energy Tax Act to comply with the Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity.

It also stipulated that a minimum payment per kWh to be granted to CHP generated electricity serving public district heating. While the original Liberalisation Act gave the Federal Provinces full discretion in setting these rates as they chose, 2003 legislation established one CHP tariff for the entire country.

The Green Electricity Act governed the aid for green energy and combined heat and power generation throughout the country, requiring, in practice, all end consumers and electricity dealers in Austria to equally finance the aid required. The Green Electricity Act established a budget limit for CHP support in Austria based on a CHP surcharge cap imposed on electricity sold to end consumers, which was to decline from 0,15 cent/kWh in 2003 to 0,05 Cent/kWh in 2010. The CHP support tariff for 2003 and 2004 was capped at 1,5 Cent/kWh or 1,25 Cent/kWh, depending on conformity to the efficiency and district heating standards laid out in the Green Electricity Act.

It transformed the subsidy scheme for renewables from fixed payments to a type of renewables portfolio standard. The legislation introduced CO2 quotas, tradable emissions allowances and renewable energy certificates for a green electricity market. To meet their quotas, it was intended that electricity distributors could develop renewable supply options or purchase renewable generation credits as proxies. The law envisaged that these market mechanisms would be developed in stages, with a view to full functionality in 2003. The framework for the bourse was to be regulated by the government; but with system regulators and net operators being responsible for measuring renewable electricity production and for issuing certificates representing the number of kilowatt hours on offer. Demand for green certificates was to be ensured by means of quotas for the purchase of renewable energy electricity, which all electricity consumers were to fulfil and which were to be laid down by the Minister for Environment and Energy. Under the terms of the Electricity Reform Agreement, the price of a green certificate was presupposed to be a minimum of DKK 0.10. A penalty price for not satisfying the renewable quota was initially introduced at a price of DKK 0.27 per kWh (akin to the maximum price for a green certificate), thereby establishing a certain degree of stability of market prices. It was anticipated that the share of electricity generated from renewable sources (principally wind turbines) was expected to rise to 20% by the end of 2003.

"3384",5517,5517,"Germany","DEU",NA,"Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz EEG)","This Act aims to double the share of electricity produced from renewable energy by 2010. The Act replaces the Electricity Feed-In Law of 1991. The obligation to give grid access to renewable energy plants and purchase the electricity at premium prices is shifted from the utilities to the grid operators. The tariffs are set for each individual technology, based on its actual generation cost. For an individual plant, the remuneration level stays fixed over twenty years, with the exception of wind power. A high remuneration is paid for a fixed total production of wind electricity. After reaching the limit the remuneration is decreased. The lower remuneration will be paid up to twenty 20 years after commissioning the plant. The remuneration paid for wind power on an average site is ? 0.084/kWh over a twenty-year lifetime. Since the remuneration for an individual plant is not adjusted for the inflation rate this means a decrease of remuneration in real terms. From 2002 on, the remuneration paid for newly commissioned plants has been reduced annually to provide stronger incentives for cost reductions. This factor is 5% for photovoltaic installations, 1.5% for wind power plants and 1% for biomass-fuelled plants. Since inflation is not considered, the real price decrease is higher than depicted by these rates. The Act also stipulates obligations concerning costs of grid connection and reinforcement. Plant operators have to pay for the grid connection, but the grid operator has to bear the cost of grid reinforcement if necessary. No public budgets are involved. The Act solves the problem of unequal distribution of burdens (as in the EFL) by requiring all electricity suppliers to have the same share of electricity from renewable energy in their fuel mix. For this purpose, grid operators need to balance amounts of electricity remunerated according to the Act in such a way that the share of the EEG electricity is equal on all grids on a three-month basis. Then all electricity suppliers using the public electricity grid are obliged to purchase an equal share of EEG electricity at a price equal to the average remuneration paid for all EEG electricity. This system has the effect that, not only the costs, but also the benefits, in the form of the generated electricity, are shared equally. This distribution mechanism can be characterised as an ex-post quota, where electricity suppliers know only ex-post the share of renewable energy electricity they are obliged to purchase. With this design, there is no need to calculate the ""real"" value of the electricity fed-in. On the other hand, the physical distribution of the renewable energy electricity among all suppliers gives rise to additional costs. The extra costs of regulation are not explicitly known. An additional ordice issued in 2001 specifies which biogenic substances and which technical processes are eligible for remuneration according to the Renewable Energy Sources Act. Originally, the remuneration to photovoltaic plants was limited to total capacity of 350 MW. In 2002, this cap was increased to 1000 MW. In November 2003, remuneration for photovoltaic installations was further differentiated depending on site specifics. A larger amendment came into force on 1 August 2004. Every two years, the parliament re-evaluates the Act on the basis of a report that is prepared by the Ministries of Economics and Technology, in close consultation with the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture. Please see the following table for details on the tariffs: www.iea.org/Textbase/pamsdb/renewable_table/table4.pdf","https://www.iea.org/policies/3858-renewable-energy-sources-act-erneuerbare-energien-gesetz-eeg",2000,NA,NA,"IEA"

Funds are allocated to relevant states and the Northern Territory on the basis of the relevant Diesel Fuel Excise paid in each jurisdiction by public generators in the years 2000-2001 to 2003-2004. At the programme start, eligibility was conditional upon applicants demonstrating that installations would displace diesel power with renewables. In December 2004, the Australian Government announced changes to the RRPGP, including: increasing eligibility for proposals to reduce any fossil fuel usage, not just diesel; expanding eligibility to include solar thermal, energy efficiency and projects on the fringe of the main grid; increasing the maximum rebate level available for some projects; and extending the deadline for expenditure of funds to 2012. Qualifying capital costs include renewable energy generation equipment, enabling/ancillary equipment (inverters, etc.) and essential expenditures such as installation costs. The programme was extended in July 2007, with the federal government designating an additional AUD 123.5 million to the programme over four years. Around AUD 328 million will be available over the life of the RRPGP. Renewable Energy Water Pumping sub-programme: The RRPGP Renewable Energy Water Pumping sub-programme provides rebates for business, government and other incorporated organisations, to support the installation of renewable energy water pumping systems in those areas of Australia not close to a main-grid. The sub-programme aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing reliance on diesel fuel for remote water pumping applications. This sub-programme provides rebates for the renewable energy components of water pumps that displace diesel engine powered pumps in off-grid applications. Residential and Medium-scale (RM) sub-programme: The RRPGP Residential and Medium-scale (RM) sub-programme commenced on 23 July 2007. This sub-programme provides rebates for households, communities, not-for-profit, business, government and other organisations, in those areas of Australia that are not close to a main grid, to support the installation of renewable generation systems (where existing RRPGP sub-programmes are not available). Rebates of up to 50% of the capital cost of renewable generation and essential enabling equipment are available to applicants that fully comply with the eligibility requirements and procedures outlined in the RM sub-programme guidelines. The Residential and Medium-scale (RM) and Renewable Energy Water Pumping sub-programmes are not currently available in Western Australia, Northern Territory or Tasmania where existing RRPGP sub programmes are still available.

"3414",5555,5555,"Finland","FIN",NA,"Wood Energy Technology Programme","The National Wood Energy Technology Programme focused on developing the production technology and improving the quality of forest chips from logging residues and small-sized trees. In 1998, energy use of forest chips in Finland amounted to 0.5 million solid-m3. The target of the programme was to reach 2.5 million m3 by 2003. Thus, the annual use of forest chips was to increase five-fold in five years. The target was to be achieved primarily by increasing the production of chips from logging residues from regeneration areas because of their better cost competitiveness. In addition, technology was also developed to promote the energy use of small-sized trees from early thinning because of the great silvicultural benefits involved. Increasing the use of forest chips required further reduction of costs. The cost of chips made from logging residues was competitive against peat and fossil fuels in favourable conditions, but large-scale use presupposed recovery of forest fuels from more difficult stand conditions and over longer distances as well. The programme also aimed to develop quality control and storage of wood fuels. The quality of chips can be seen as a cost factor, since the energy obtained from the chips, emissions and reliability of delivery all depend upon fuel properties. Quality improvement was not confined solely to forest chips. It is just as important for the process residues from the forest industry. For this reason the scope of the programme also included bark, sawdust and other solid wood residues from the forest industry that are suitable for fuel.","https://www.iea.org/policies/3472-wood-energy-technology-programme",1999,NA,NA,"IEA"

ERES include wind, solar, water, biomass and geothermal where the electricity is generated from emerging and innovative applications. After consulting with electrical utilities and the renewable energy industry, NRCan announced its intention to start pilot projects to purchase electricity from renewable sources. In 1997, NRCan began purchasing electricity from ERES from ENMAX, Calgarys electric system. The ten-year agreement with ENMAX is for the production of 10 000 megawatt hours of electricity from renewable sources for NRCan<U+00B4>s Alberta facilities. Environment Canada also signed an agreement with ENMAX for 2 000 megawatt hours of green electricity for their electricity requirements in Alberta. Together, NRCan and Environment Canada agreements will displace more than 10 000 tonnes of CO2 annually. In 2000, NRCan signed a ten-year agreement with SaskPower, Saskatchewans electric utility and is receiving about 32 000 megawatt hours annually of wind power for its facilities in Saskatchewan. Early in 2001, NRCan signed an agreement with Maritime Electric from Prince Edward Island to purchase electricity from ERES. This ten-year agreement is for the production of 13 000 megawatt hours annually of wind power. The pilot projects in Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island will deliver about 40 000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions reductions annually. Under ""Action Plan 2000 on Climate Change"", it was expected that the federal government would purchase an additional 400 000 megawatt hours or so of electricity from ERES. Assuming a continued focus on the displacement of high-carbon electricity, these 400 000 megawatt hours would come from several provinces, particularly Nova Scotia, Ontario and New Brunswick, with additional purchases in Alberta. These purchases would result in a further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of about 200 000 tonnes annually. In 2004, the Government of Canada signed a 5-year agreement for 90 000 megawatt hours of electricity from Energy Ottawa in Ontario. New agreements are no longer being negotiated under this program. The goal of the Government purchases of electricity from ERES was to: * Provide a ""first customer"" to help interested utilities gain experience with different electricity products. * Achieve emissions reductions in federal operations. * Leverage first purchases to create viable green power markets.","https://www.iea.org/policies/3996-government-purchases-of-electricity-from-renewable-resources",1997,NA,NA,"IEA"

Tax subsidies are paid for power production based on renewable energy sources. These subsidies were extended in 2003 to cover nearly all power production based on renewable energy sources, except for large-scale hydropower. However, in 2007 subsidies were removed from electricity produced using wood and wood-based fuels except for forest chips. Furthermore, they were removed from electricity produced with the waste gases from metallurgical processes and the reaction heat from chemical processes. Due to the changes in the operating environment caused by the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, these production types are considered competitive and therefore ineligible for subsidies. As of 1 January 2007, electricity produced through windpower, small-scale hydropower (below 1 MVA), recycled fuels, biogas and forest chips are eligible for subsidies.

"3442",5607,5607,"Denmark","DNK",NA,"Green Tax Package 1995","Based on the Green Tax Package 1995, provided for reform of the tax system between 1996 and 2000. It contained four principal elements: - three tax elements consisting of an energy tax, a CO2 tax and an SO2 tax; - a distinction between three different purposes for energy use when assessing the tax: space heating, light industrial processes and heavy industrial processes; - provisions for a significantly reduced tax rate in the case of specific energy-intensive activities, conditional upon a business committing itself to reducing energy consumption through an agreement negotiated between the company and the Danish Energy Agency (if the company did not fulfil the agreement, reimbursements already paid had to be returned and the tax imposed in full); and - gradual phase-in of the taxes. A large part of the additional revenues from the Green Tax Package were transferred back to enterprises through reduced taxation on employing labour and reductions in employers social security contributions. A smaller share was redirected to the industry and service sectors to provide investment grants for energy efficiency measures. These grants could be up to 30% of the initial outlay on a project with a payback period of between two and nine years. About DKK 1.8 billion (Eur 242 million) was set aside for these subsidies (capital grants) for 1996-2000. The Danish Energy Agency (now the Danish Energy Authority) established a list of 40 standard solutions for energy efficiency improvements and determined which projects would qualify. Eligible projects had to increase energy efficiency, reduce CO2 or SO2 emissions or be of a developmental character. Companies could also suggest individual solutions. Applications for support rose from 2,800 in 1996 to 7,000 in 2000. In an evaluation carried out in 1999, the government estimated that the Green Tax Package 1995 resulted in a net decrease of the overall tax burden by DKK 335 million and that CO2 emissions from industry in 2005 would be reduced by 3.8%, corresponding to 2.3 million tonnes1. Half of this was due to the taxes and the rest to subsidy and voluntary agreement schemes. In the case of the CO2 tax, the difference between the tax rate with and without voluntary agreements grew significantly between 1996 and 2001. EARLIER HISTORY OF ENERGY TAXATION IN DENMARK: Taxation of energy products has a long history in Denmark, dating back to the first tax on petrol introduced in 1917. As of 1980, taxation of a large number of products through the economy was motivated in part by environmental considerations and to save resources, especially energy. Energy taxes comprise taxes and duties on carbon dioxide, sulphur, electricity, natural gas, petrol and specific petroleum products. In 1991, energy taxes were reformed into an energy and carbon tax to reflect Denmarks environmental concerns. A large share of the tax revenues was used for energy efficiency measures and since the tax system came into effect in 1992 it has been expanded. Denmark embarked on a green tax reform to shift the tax burden away from income and towards resource use. This system was put into place between 1994 and 1998. Energy taxes were raised progressively, particularly on coal and electricity consumption, leading to an average increase in taxation on heating and power of 30% from 1994 to 1998. The main effect was that households paid lower income taxes and higher environmental taxes.","https://www.iea.org/policies/2202-green-tax-package-1995",1995,NA,NA,"IEA"

For the countrys interconnected system, the Law established a fixed sale rate for renewable energy at a level equal to 90 percent of the medium-voltage, general use tariff and made it obligatory for the PPC to buy that energy. The final rate in 2006 corresponded to 0.07287 Euro/kWh.

"3465",5640,5640,"Germany","DEU",NA,"Electricity Feed-In Law of 1991 (""Stromeinspeisungsgesetz"")","The 1991 Electricity Feed-in Law ensured grid access for electricity generated from renewable energy sources. Moreover, it obliged utilities operating the public grid to pay premium prices (feed-in tariffs) for the electricity supplied from these renewable energy power plants. No public budget funds were involved, as the burden imposed by the law was exclusively borne by electricity suppliers and their customers. The premiums in the Electricity Feed-In Law were calculated annually as a percentage of the mean specific revenues for all electricity sold via the public electricity grid in the previous year, i.e., the average electricity price for all customers. In this way, the remuneration changed every year. Wind power plants and solar power plants received the highest remuneration with 90% of the mean specific revenues, followed by small hydro, biomass and biogas power plants smaller than 500 kW with 75%, (remuneration rose to 80% some years later). Hydro, biomass and biogas power plants larger than 500 kW, but smaller than 5 MW, received 65% of the mean specific revenues. The law did not cover plants larger than 5 MEW. The premium prices or tariffs decreased after 1996. This was because electricity prices had declined due to the phasing out of the coal levy (""Kohlepfennig""), and later due to the liberalisation of power markets. Thus, most generation facilities based on renewable energy sources that existed at the time of introduction of the Electricity Feed-In Law were excluded. It was then ensured that mainly new facilities would benefit from the law. The duration of the remuneration for an individual plant was not fixed; however, the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations provided some certainty to renewable energy generators. The law was amended in 1998, as the Electricity Feed-In Law had placed a significant, although unequal, financial burden on some utilities (especially those near the coast where the majority of wind turbines were situated). A ""double cap"" was introduced in the Electricity Feed-In Law, limiting the amount of renewable energy electricity that had to be remunerated according to the law. Regional electricity suppliers only had to purchase a maximum share of 5% of renewable energy electricity of their total electricity supply. The same cap applied to preliminary suppliers, leading to a total cap of 10%. This way, the total burden from the law was limited for individual utilities and their customers. The 10% threshold was almost reached in certain areas in northern Germany in 2000, which would have created a barrier for the further deployment of wind power technology.

The institutional framework was established as part of the 1989 Electricity Act. The NFFO in England and Wales and similar obligations in Scotland and Northern Ireland required electricity supply companies to secure specified amounts of new generating capacity from non-fossil sources, including renewables.The NFFO process began with the governments announcement of proposals for an order covering specific technology bands. Five orders were carried out during the programmes span. The Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency (NFPA), an agent through which the electricity suppliers contracted collectively with renewable generators, issued bids for prospective schemes for specific technologies. Renewable energy generators competed in a tender process. Each scheme that passed a ""will-secure"" test submitted a final bid and the government then selected the cheapest schemes to secure the required capacity within each technology band. The renewables capacity was secured through contracts with generators at premium prices. The guaranteed contractual price was made up of the pool price and a technology-specific premium. Additional costs incurred by the electricity suppliers under these contracts were financed through the Non-Fossil Fuel Levy. It was funded by all final electricity consumers as a levy on electricity consumption. The levy is also used to support nuclear power. The levy rate was set by the regulatory body each year, and in 2003 stood at 0.3% of the cost of fossil-fuel sources of electricity.NFFO 1: 1990-1998NFFO 2: 1991-1999NFFO 3: 1994- 2014NFFO 4: 1997- 2016NFFO 5: 1998- 2018","https://www.iea.org/policies/3867-non-fossil-fuel-obligation",1990,NA,NA,"IEA"
