between 1991 and 1997. These audits helped companies identify opportunities for energy savings.
Under its ‘Environmental Management Program: a Business Approach’, the Commonwealth
Government provides assistance to companies to take up the challenge of cleaner production and
waste management and of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This program includes an Energy
Management Module that helps companies quantify the savings they can make by identifying and

"2","Australia","AUS","NC2",1994,"Natural Gas Industry Reform","Natural gas is Australia’s fastest growing energy source and, as a clean and efficient source of energy,
has an important role to play in helping to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The
Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments agreed in February 1994 to implement reform of
the gas sector to allow free and fair trade in natural gas. The primary focus of reform has been to establish a regulatory framework to facilitate nationally consistent third-party access to transmission and distribution pipelines through the National Third Party Access Code. This recently finalised Code will enable market participants to deal with pipeliners on fair and reasonable terms, while providing pipeline investors with the opportunity to earn a fair and
reasonable return on capital, commensurate with the risks involved. A legislative package to give effect
to the Code has been finalised. Through CoAG, all Governments have agreed to implement the Code
progressively during the first half of 1998.
Implementation of the Code will promote competition in the delivery of gas, leading to lower prices
and greater choice for consumers and reduced input costs for key exporting industries. In
conjunction with electricity reform, the Code is driving integration in the provision of gas and
electricity, encouraging optimal energy choice and the increased use of cogeneration .","https://unfccc.int/documents/198647",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"

"4","Australia","AUS","NC2",1997,"Electricity Industry Reform","Electricity industry reform in Australia was initiated by CoAG as part of broader economic reforms.
Major restructuring of the industry has been taking place following agreement to establish a fully competitive integrated national electricity market across the generation, retail and distribution sectors
by 2001.
The first stage of a competitive electricity market in southern and eastern Australia was introduced in
Victoria, NSW and the ACT in 1997. South Australian generators will join the national market when
the market systems are fully operational in 1998, while Queensland and Tasmania will join following
grid interconnection.
The new market arrangements separate the industry’s sectors to allow for competition in generation,
in purchasing from the central dispatch ‘pool’ and in the provision of services at the retail level. A
system of light-handed national competition regulation of the remaining monopoly (network)
elements will encourage increased efficiencies through time, and appropriate investment in networks
and in upstream and downstream markets.
The reforms also encourage the removal of existing capital subsidies and cross-subsidies, so as to
promote cost-reflective pricing. This is a key measure for the promotion of efficient competition in
supply by embedded cogeneration and renewable energy sources. It will also promote more sensible
patterns of energy use through greater incentives for investment in energy efficiency. In recognition
of the importance of pricing to efficient, environmentally sound outcomes, a review of the proposed
network pricing arrangements will be undertaken in 1998.","https://unfccc.int/documents/198647",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"

Funds are allocated to relevant states and the Northern Territory on the basis of the relevant Diesel Fuel Excise paid in each jurisdiction by public generators in the years 2000-2001 to 2003-2004. At the programme start, eligibility was conditional upon applicants demonstrating that installations would displace diesel power with renewables. In December 2004, the Australian Government announced changes to the RRPGP, including: increasing eligibility for proposals to reduce any fossil fuel usage, not just diesel; expanding eligibility to include solar thermal, energy efficiency and projects on the fringe of the main grid; increasing the maximum rebate level available for some projects; and extending the deadline for expenditure of funds to 2012. Qualifying capital costs include renewable energy generation equipment, enabling/ancillary equipment (inverters, etc.) and essential expenditures such as installation costs. The programme was extended in July 2007, with the federal government designating an additional AUD 123.5 million to the programme over four years. Around AUD 328 million will be available over the life of the RRPGP. Renewable Energy Water Pumping sub-programme: The RRPGP Renewable Energy Water Pumping sub-programme provides rebates for business, government and other incorporated organisations, to support the installation of renewable energy water pumping systems in those areas of Australia not close to a main-grid. The sub-programme aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing reliance on diesel fuel for remote water pumping applications. This sub-programme provides rebates for the renewable energy components of water pumps that displace diesel engine powered pumps in off-grid applications. Residential and Medium-scale (RM) sub-programme: The RRPGP Residential and Medium-scale (RM) sub-programme commenced on 23 July 2007. This sub-programme provides rebates for households, communities, not-for-profit, business, government and other organisations, in those areas of Australia that are not close to a main grid, to support the installation of renewable generation systems (where existing RRPGP sub-programmes are not available). Rebates of up to 50% of the capital cost of renewable generation and essential enabling equipment are available to applicants that fully comply with the eligibility requirements and procedures outlined in the RM sub-programme guidelines.

The Australian Government’s Local Greenhouse Action measure was announced in the 2004–05 Federal Budget. It integrates the following previously separate programmes: Cities for Climate Protection™ Australia (CCP™ Australia); Travel Demand Management; Household Greenhouse Action; and Cool Communities. These programmes have been streamlined in order to engage a larger number of Australian households and communities in greenhouse action over the long term, and on a more cost-effective basis. Funding of $13.6 million over four years to 2007–08 has been committed to this measure to encourage and facilitate greenhouse gas abatement by local governments and the community through: maintaining and increasing abatement from the operations of local government through CCP™ Australia, using local government as the key conduit to the community by providing incentives for local government to take action with local households, transport systems and businesses, leveraging the complementary role of local government in planning and infrastructure provision, increasing the information and resources available to encourage community greenhouse gas abatement. Abatement and capacity building will be achieved through targeted grant programmes, partnership projects with various levels of government, the provision of information, the commissioning of research, and the provision of programme support through the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives. The Travel Demand Management Programme complements TravelSmart activities already underway, as reported in Australia’s Third National Communication. Under the initiative, the Australian Government is engaging with state, territory and local governments and communities to support various approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from passenger transport, particularly in urban centres.

The Australian Government’s $31.6 million Greenhouse Challenge Plus Programme was announced in 2004. It builds upon the success of the Greenhouse Challenge Programme (reported in Australia’s Third National Communication), to strengthen the partnership between the Australian Government and industry to abate greenhouse gas emissions.
The programme is designed to help companies reduce their emissions, integrate greenhouse issues into business decision making and accelerate the uptake of energy efficiency. The new Greenhouse Challenge Plus Programme recognises businesses’ different levels of response to managing greenhouse gas emissions through a tiered approach to programme membership, incorporating partnerships on a
voluntary, incentive-based and compulsory basis. All existing members of the Greenhouse Challenge programmes became members of Greenhouse Challenge Plus. Greenhouse Challenge Plus has around 800 participants, representing almost 50% of greenhouse gas emissions from industry. In particular, it has excellent coverage of companies in key sectors, including electricity supply, oil and gas, aluminium, cement, mining and manufacturing. Most member companies participate voluntarily, but from July 2006, companies that receive more than $3 million per year of business fuel credits will be required to join the programme. In addition, a new requirement for proponents of major energy resource developments to join Greenhouse Challenge Plus is being developed.
Under Greenhouse Challenge Plus, businesses measure and monitor greenhouse gas emissions and deliver maximum practical greenhouse gas abatement by working towards specific milestones set out under individual agreements.
The Australian Government provides administrative and technical support for the programme.
The programme also allows companies that wish to go further in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions to be
identified as Greenhouse Leaders by agreeing to achieve a greenhouse gas abatement goal and report publicly on the
outcomes.
Greenhouse Challenge Plus also integrates the Generator Efficiency Standards (GES) and the Greenhouse Friendly programmes (as reported in Australia’s Third National Communication) into a single streamlined programme. This integration is being achieved through common verification
and reporting arrangements and through a new online reporting tool.
By May 2004, 17 companies, representing 85% of Australian electricity generation capacity, had signed up to the GES, and some have already started implementing their action plans. The Greenhouse Challenge, GES, and Greenhouse Friendly
components of Greenhouse Challenge Plus together are expected to lead to abatement of an estimated 15.8 Mt CO2 -e

Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the ACT.Green Power aims to facilitate the installation of new renewable energy generators across Australia, beyond mandatory renewable requirements. Under the programme, customers can elect to pay a premium to their energy retailers for the supply of electricity generated from renewable sources (solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal). Accredited energy suppliers then agree to buy an amount of energy from renewable sources equivalent to the amount nominated by participating consumers and businesses. The programme has similar objectives to MRET—to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity generation sector and drive investment in renewable energy projects— but whereas MRET is a mandatory  (legislated) requirement, Green Power relies on consumers voluntarily paying a premium. Green Power provided by retailers to meet customer demand cannot be ‘double counted’ to contribute to meeting their MRET obligations. Ongoing compliance of products is checked regularly
via financial and technical status reports provided by the energy supplier. Independent audits are carried out by the New South Wales Department of Energy Utilities

investing in energy efficiency, renewable energy and low emissions technology projects that improve
Australian cities.
• Reef Funding Program: The Program provides up to $1 billion over 10 years for clean energy projects
benefiting the health of the Great Barrier Reef. The Reef Funding Program will contribute to the
implementation of the Reef 2050 Plan, the overarching framework for protecting and managing the Great
Barrier Reef.
The CEFC also works through banks and other financial institutions to offer financial products to encourage
businesses to make sustainable purchasing choices for energy efficient equipment, fuel efficient, electric and

electricity retailers to contract with or directly invest in energy resources to supply an amount of dispatchable
energy while also meeting a specified emissions level for the electricity they buy. The Government is working
with the Energy Security Board and the states and territories through the COAG Energy Council to implement the
National Energy Guarantee.
How it works
The Guarantee will require energy retailers and some large energy users to ensure that the electricity they
contract for or purchase meets both a reliability and an emissions target.
Ultimately, each individual retailer will determine how they meet the requirements under the Guarantee.
Retailers can do this within their existing portfolio of generators, by investing in new generation assets, or by
contracting directly with generators, storage or demand response services that:
• the system maintains a minimum amount of dispatchable capacity to meet customer and system
reliability needs
• the emissions associated with electricity purchased in the market are aligned with Australia’s emissions
reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement.

developed by the CSIRO, and highlights opportunities to grow Australia’s clean technology sector, fast track
emissions reductions and be part of future global supply chains.
The roadmap considered the scope for new technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy
sector (including electricity generation, heat production, direct combustion, transport, electricity and fuel
consumption and fugitive emissions from coal mines, coal seam gas operations and gas pipelines).
It considered the possible mix of energy technologies to make a greater contribution to meeting Australia’s
2030 emissions reduction target (and longer term emissions reduction goals) at least cost. Priority was given to
technologies where Australia can become a major part of a global supply chain.
A report under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
The roadmap explored the potential economic opportunities for Australian industry through deployment of
relevant technologies or by participating in growing low emission fuel and technology supply chains.
The roadmap considered four options or ‘pathways’ to decarbonisation of the energy sector, which in
2016 accounted for 79 per cent of Australia’s emissions.
The report found:
• Australia is endowed with energy-rich resources and is well positioned to benefit from innovation in
low-emission technologies.
• Energy productivity will remain important in reducing energy costs and emission levels throughout
the transition.
• While the technology pathways are comparable in terms of cost, they carry different levels of commercial,
technical, social, and stakeholder risks.

energy research and development (R&D) as part of global efforts to accelerate innovation breakthroughs in clean
energy technologies. Along with 21 other member countries plus the European Union, the Australian Government
has pledged to double public expenditure on clean energy R&D from 2015 levels by 2020.
In joining the global Mission Innovation initiative, Australia pledged to double early stage government clean
energy R&D expenditure to at least $216 million by 2020, equivalent to approximately US$170 million. The scope
of Australia’s pledge encompasses the areas of renewable energy, energy storage, fuel cells and smart grids,
energy efficiency, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage.
Mission Innovation government expenditure is expected to encourage substantial private investment in new
technology. For example, through the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, Bill Gates has committed US$1 billion
and garnered support from 27 other billionaires across ten countries to direct capital to clean energy projects in
participating countries.
Australia is taking a keen interest in four of the seven Innovation Challenges established under Mission
Innovation: in smart grids, carbon capture and storage, converting sunlight, and affordable heating and cooling of
buildings. Australia has research expertise in all seven Innovation Challenges, and the Australian Government will
be working to support participation in the challenges across the Australian research community.
ARENA will play a key role in delivering Australia’s Mission Innovation commitment, both by providing funding
for clean energy R&D, and by supporting participation in the Innovation Challenges. The Australian Department
of the Environment and Energy will work with the Australian Research Council and the CSIRO to encourage more
funding proposals from the clean energy R&D community. These agencies will develop strategic work programs

productivity by 2030. It consolidates national, state and territory government and industry measures to provide a
national framework and an initial economy-wide work plan.
The NEPP aims to boost competitiveness and growth, help families and businesses manage their energy costs and
reduce emissions. This is being done through a package of 34 measures which support:
• smarter energy choices (by providing more efficient incentives, empowering consumers and promoting
business action)
• better energy services (by driving greater innovation, more competitive and modern markets and updating
consumer protections and standards).
Key achievements of the NEPP include:
• Tighter energy standards for equipment: the Equipment Energy Efficiency (E3) program delivers a single,
integrated program on energy efficiency standards and energy labelling for equipment and appliances.
To accelerate the impact of the E3 program, new proposed standards have been consulted on for air
conditioners, commercial refrigerated display cabinets, industrial fans, swimming pool pumps, lighting,
refrigerators and freezers. These measures will deliver an estimated $7 billion in economic benefits and
reduce emissions by 45 MtCO2
-e (cumulative to 2030).
• Expansion of the Commercial Building Disclosure program: requires most sellers and lessors of large office
spaces to provide energy efficiency information to prospective buyers and tenants. From 1 July 2017 the
mandatory disclosure threshold for buildings size was lowered from 2,000 square metres to 1,000 square
metres. This will lead to an estimated $50 million in new energy savings, and about 3.5 MtCO2
-e reduction,
calculated on a five year program duration, between the years of 2015 and 2019.
• Improved energy efficiency of residential buildings: targeted industry training and tools are being
delivered to improve compliance with the energy performance requirements of the Australian National
Construction Code, and ensure residential buildings are built to need less energy for heating and cooling.
• Robust energy use data: the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is
creating an Energy Use Data Model to understand Australians’ energy consumption and influencing factors
such as a change in climate, exponential growth in use of solar electricity, and increasing energy efficiency.
Further improvements to the NEPP are underway. These include consideration of opportunities to improve energy
productivity in the Australian Government’s operations and the introduction of cost-reflective electricity pricing
and competitive metering. The COAG Energy Council has committed $8 million in its 2016–17 budget to support
collaborative work on a number of measures. NEPP measures include:
• Funding of $160,000 over 2017–18 for Victoria to develop a pilot of the Victorian Residential Efficiency
Scorecard’s assessment tool, which measures the energy efficiency of existing homes. This will allow
jurisdictions across Australia to test the Scorecard’s assessment tool.
• Implementation of the Australian Government’s Smart Cities Plan, including the $100 million a year
Sustainable Cities Investment Fund. The aim is to accelerate the deployment of clean energy, renewable
energy and energy efficiency technology in cities. This will be partially driven through negotiation of initial
City Deals.

Royal Decree concerning the green certificates; this decree sets the minimum proportion of electricity
derived from renewable energy at 6% by 2010. Suppliers that cannot meet this condition will be required
to pay fines.
The Flemish Government has also taken the option of imposing a minimum standard (3% by the end of
2004, 5% in 2010) for the proportion of renewable energy on the electricity suppliers, by means of a
system of green certificates. The supplier fulfils its obligations by depositing a certain volume of green
certificates annually. These have to be deposited with the regulatory body of the Flemish Region. If it
happens that one of these suppliers cannot satisfy its obligations, a fine is imposed. These fines will
supply a fund that will be used for the promotion of renewable energy resources. Finally, the transport
of renewable electricity via the distribution network is exempted of taxes. A similar system of
certificates will be introduced for CHP.
In the Walloon Region, “green” electricity will be also be promoted by the system of green certificates,
plus via a system of support to production. The priority is the use of biomass, including various types
of biodegradable waste. Then small-scale hydro-electricity (<10 MW), active and passive solar heating

certain weighting, from “quality” CHP. In Brussels-Capital Region, as in the two other regions, a system of green certificates will be set up. Two

"156","Belgium","BEL","NC6",2009,"The National Climate Plan (2009-2012)","The National Climate Plan is based on all the policies and measures contained in the regional climate plans and those for which the federal authorities are competent. It was drawn up first and foremost to enable Belgium to meet its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.
The National Climate Plan is not set
in stone: formal provision has been made
for annual results-based adaptation deriving from monitoring the impact of these
policies.
The first objective of the National
Climate Plan is to formalise the major
strategic priority measures that Belgium
must implement. The aim is in particular to optimise the impact of policies
and measures rolled out by the various
competent authorities so as to develop
synergies and identify complementary
approaches, while taking into consideration the respective competences of
these bodies.
Eleven strategic areas (or fields of
interest) have been identified for this
purpose:
Six sectoral strategic areas have been
defined:
1. Optimisation of energy production
2. Rational use of energy in buildings
3. Influence on industrial processes
4. Development of sustainable means
of transport
5. Encouragement of the sustainable
management of agricultural and forest ecosystems
6. Boosting of waste management efforts
The plan contains five additional broader-based strategic areas:
7. Stepping up of research on climate
change
8. Raising the awareness of all Belgian
stakeholders about tackling climate
change
9. Increase the direct involvement of
the public authorities in reducing
greenhouse gas emissions
10. Implementation of flexible mechanisms
11. Incorporation of climate issues into
the development aid policy
A set of concrete policies and measures
has been produced for each strategic area.
The National Climate Plan establishes priority strategic area undertakings for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2
equivalent) in relation to a baseline.
The second objective of the National Climate Plan is to set up a coordinated monitoring system in order to monitor,
evaluate and adapt policies and measures.
The National Climate Commission is in
charge of regular assessment of the implementation of the National Climate Plan. It
has two types of instruments at its disposal:
– firstly, greenhouse gas emission projection models enabling a ‘rough’ estimation to be made of the impact of policies and measures;
– and, secondly, a database containing
policy and measure impact indicators
with regular updating by the Permanent Secretariat of the National Climate
Commission.
The third objective of the National
Climate Plan is to initiate the drawing up
of a national climate change adaptation
strategy. All sectors need to be prepared
for the inevitable consequences of a rise in
temperatures. This version of the National Climate Plan raises only a few issues.
Since then the National Adaptation Strategy has been adopted (see chapter 6 of this
document for more details).
Finally, the fourth objective of the National Climate Plan is to prepare a longterm strategy to tackle climate change.
The deadlines for which Belgium has to
prepare are, on the one hand, a 2nd phase
of the Kyoto Protocol and, on the other
hand, the negotiations taking place at the
United Nations with a view to drawing up
an ambitious international agreement by
2015. It is also a matter of defining a path
for transition, encouraged by the European
authorities, towards a low-carbon society
in Europe by 2050, a necessary condition,
but one which is not sufficient in itself, to
avoid excessive global warming.","https://unfccc.int/documents/198304",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"

in the world, and the Government of Canada has taken
steps to make it even cleaner by introducing a tough
new regulatory performance standard for coal-fired
electricity generation. On September 12, 2012, the
Government of Canada published in final form the
Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired
Generation of Electricity Regulations. The Regulations
apply a stringent emissions intensity limit (performance
standard) to new coal-fired electricity generation units
and to old units that have reached the end of their
useful life. The Regulations will ensure that coal-fired
electricity generation in Canada operates as cleanly as
high efficiency natural gas-fired electricity generation
and that no new high-emitting coal-fired electricity
units will be built in Canada.
Under the Regulations, the performance standard is
set at the emissions intensity level of 420 tonnes
CO2
/gigawatt hours (GWh). The standard will address
emissions of CO2
 from the combustion of coal, coal
derivatives (e.g., syngas) and petroleum coke (petcoke),
and from all fuels burned in conjunction with any of
the preceding fuel, except for biomass. The Regulations
also contain flexibilities to maintain the integrity
of the electricity system while still achieving the
environmental objective of emission reductions. The performance standard provisions of the
Regulations come into force on July 1, 2015. Any new
units commissioned after that date will need to meet
the performance standard. In 2020, the first old units
will be subject to the performance standard, resulting,
in that year, in an estimated emissions reduction of 3 megatonnes (Mt) CO2
 eq. The Regulations, in
addition to other measures and commitments made
by industry and provinces, particularly Ontario’s
mandated cessation of coal-fired electricity generation
by the end of 2014, are projected to reduce emissions
of carbon dioxide from this sector by 41 Mt below
2005 levels by 2020. This constitutes a 33% reduction
in GHG emissions from electricity generation for
the year 2020. Significant further reductions will
occur in subsequent years. Over the first 21 years, the
Regulations are expected to result in a cumulative
reduction of about 214 Mt of GHGs, equivalent to
removing some 2.6 million personal vehicles from
the road per year over this period. In addition to

"248","Canada","CAN","NC7",2019,"Federal Carbon Pricing Approach and Backstop System","As described previously, in October 2016, the federal
government published a benchmark requiring that
carbon pricing applies to a broad set of emission sources
throughout Canada, with increasing stringency over
time. A federal carbon pricing backstop system will be
applied in jurisdictions that request it or that do not
have a carbon pricing system in place in 2018 that meets
the pan-Canadian carbon pricing benchmark. The
federal system would take effect January 1, 2019.
Under this system, provinces and territories will have
the flexibility to implement either an explicit pricebased system (a carbon tax such as the one in British
Columbia, or a hybrid approach composed of a carbon
levy and an output-based pricing system, such as in
Alberta) or a cap and trade system (such as those in
Québec and Ontario).
In addition to the parameters above, the benchmark also
stipulates the following:
• Pricing will be based on GHG emissions and applied
to a common and broad set of emissions sources to
ensure effectiveness and minimize interprovincial
competitiveness impacts.
• Stringency of pricing systems will increase over
time to contribute to the national target and provide
market certainty.
– For jurisdictions with an explicit price-based system,
the carbon price should start at a minimum of $10
per tonne in 2018, and rise by $10 per year to $50
per tonne in 2022.
– Jurisdictions with cap and trade systems need:
(i) a 2030 emissions reduction target equal to or
greater than Canada’s 30 per cent reduction target;
(ii) declining (more stringent) annual caps to at
least 2022 that correspond, at a minimum, to the
projected emissions reductions resulting from the
carbon price that year in price-based systems.
• Revenues from pricing systems are to remain in the
jurisdiction of origin and used according to their
needs including, for example, to address impacts on
vulnerable populations and sectors and to support
climate change and clean growth goals.
• The overall approach to carbon pricing will be
reviewed by early 2022 to confirm the path forward,
including continued increases in stringency.
• Jurisdictions are to provide regular, transparent and
verifiable reports on the outcomes and impacts of
carbon pricing policies.

territories to address their specific challenges.","https://unfccc.int/documents/198352",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"

is differentiated between sectors. Industry and professional
glasshouse growers are entitled to pay tax
approximately at a rate equal to the one effective in the
former system. For all other users of electricity, the rate
was doubled in the reform. In the case of heat generation,
the component based on energy content was
removed, whereas the component based on the carbon
content was approximately doubled to FIM 70 per tonne

"285","Finland","FIN","NC2",1993,"Revised Excise Duty","The excise duty on liquid fuels is levied on car petrol,
on diesel oil, as well as light fuel oil for commercial,
industrial and heating purposes and heavy fuel oil. An
excise duty on certain energy sources is levied on coal, milled peat, natural gas, electricity and pine oil.
Additives and extenders in fuels are subject to the
excise duty under the same principles as the fuel in
question. Light fuel oil, vaporising oil and paraffin oil
must contain a reactive reagent for revealing
unauthorized use.
The excise duties were revised in 1993–94, in line
with the EU regulation. The duty consists of a basic tax and an additional environmentally based tax. The basic duty is primarily a fiscal tax determined annually in the State budget proposal. The basic duty is, however, differentiated to promote environmental protection.
In the case of motor petrol, there is a lower tax on
unleaded and reformulated grades, and in the case of
diesel oil on the desulphurized grade. The basic duty
is also levied on light and heavy fuel oil, pine oil and
nuclear power. Tax revenues derive primarily from liquid traffic fuels, however.
The additional environmentally based duty was
determined in 1994–96 according to the energy and
carbon content of the fuel or energy source. As a rule,
the tax was imposed on primary energy inputs, thus
encouraging improvements in energy efficiency and
production techniques.
The yardstick when calculating the additional tax for
the years 1994–96 was heavy fuel oil; 75% of the tax
was based on the carbon content and 25% on the
energy content. Therefore, the Finnish CO2 tax system was often referred to as the ”75/25 model” as opposed to the ”50/50 model” proposed within the EU. In 1996, the tax component on carbon content was FIM 38.3 per tonne CO2 and that on energy content FIM 3.5 per MWh. The additional taxes on all fuels are determined according to unit taxes worked out in this way.
For nuclear and hydropower, the additional environment tax was levied only on energy content. The energy duty component for nuclear power was the same as for electricity generated in coal-fired condensing plants, where the efficiency coefficient is about 38%. The duty on hydropower was worked out by applying the standard rate of energy content directly to the amount of electricity generated.
As a general rule, no additional tax is levied on
renewable energy sources. Thus, for example, wind
power and the use of waste and wood-based biomass
are not taxed. Only the energy component of the duty
applied to peat, as a consequence of the VAT reform.
The estimated revenues from the excise duty on
fuels and energy products in 1996 were FIM 13.6
billion, representing 2% of GDP. The basic tax accounted for FIM 11 billion and the additional duty for
FIM 2.6 billion. About 60% of additional duty revenues
came from the carbon dioxide component and 40%
from the energy component.
The problem with the system was that few countries
have introduced corresponding taxes. Even those which have, have tried to safeguard the competitiveness of their industry either through low tax levels or by granting special concessions. This was especially the case with domestic electricity production, which was no longer competitive in the liberalized Nordic electricity market.
The tax on imported electricity probably also went
against the Treaty of Rome.
From the beginning of 1997, the energy tax system
was reformed again. A uniform tax was imposed on all
electricity generated and the taxes on input fuels of
electricity production were removed. The electricity tax is differentiated between sectors.

The Energy Audit Programme is one of the oldest national energy efficiency grant schemes in place in Finland. The full-scale programme was launched in January 1994.
The purpose of energy auditing is to analyse the energy use of the facility being audited, to work out the potential for energy savings and to present a profitability calculation of saving proposals. In addition to working out possible ways to use different forms of renewable energy and the energy saving
potentials, the energy audit reports on the impact of the proposed measures on CO2 emissions.
The Energy Audit Programme is a voluntary programme promoted by a 40 to 50 per cent subsidy by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy. The ministry provides subsidies for conducting energy audits on commercial and public buildings and in the industrial and energy sectors. It also supports municipalities to carry out audits concerning the promotion of renewable energy use within the municipality’s territory (Renewable Energy Municipal Audit). Apart from energy audits subsidised by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, there are energy audits intended for blocks of flats and terraced housing. Subsidies for private sector buildings are granted by municipalities, whereas subsidies for municipal housing stock are granted by the Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland (ARA). The Ministry of the Environment determines the total annual amount of these subsidies. By the end of 2010, the estimated savings in energy achieved by conducting audits in the service, municipal and industry sectors were approximately 1.0 TWh per year. About 90 per cent of the savings originated in the industry sector. The corresponding CO2 reduction was 0.98 million tonnes CO2 per year (based on a marginal emissions rate of 600 kg CO2/MWh for
electricity). The emissions reduction is estimated to be 0.65 million CO2
tonnes per year by the end of 2015 and 0.56 million tonnes per year by the
end of 2020 (an example of an implemented energy saving measure is presented in Box 4.3). While 90 per cent of the energy audits are implemented
in connection with the energy efficiency agreements, overlap in energy savings and emission reductions has been removed in the estimates and the

Total new savings from measures under the energy efficiency agreements
(2008−2016) within the industry, energy, municipal, property and building
sectors were approximately 5.5 TWh per year at the end of 2011 (Figure
4.2). More than one third of the energy saved was electricity. The savings
were equal to 1.4 per cent of Finland’s total energy consumption (386 TWh in 2011). For example, in 2010 in the food and drink industry approximately
one third of the savings arose from measures related to heat recovery, while
roughly one third of the savings were related to the heating of buildings.
Within the plastic industry, one third of savings stemmed from more efficient
process cooling. Within the energy intensive industry, savings in the actual
process equipment and processes accounted for more than half of the savings,
while measures addressing, e.g. steam and condensate, were also significant.
CO2 reductions under the energy efficiency agreements were approximately 4.1 million tonnes CO2 per year at the end of 2010 (based on a marginal emissions rate of 600 kg CO2/MWh for electricity). It is estimated that
by the end of 2015, the emissions reduction will be 5.9 million CO2 tonnes
per year, and 5.2 million tonnes per year by 2020 when taking into account
the termination of current agreements at the end of 2016 (see Table 4.4).
Additional emissions reductions have been achieved as a result of the energy efficiency agreement (2008–2016) for the oil sector. These amounted to

The working group suggests that a market-based guaranteed price be introduced for
wind power in Finland. The guaranteed price
for wind power would be introduced in early
2010 for a period of 12 years. At the initial stage, the guaranteed price for
wind power determined by the authorities would be EUR 83.5/MWh. The
difference between the market price of electricity and the guaranteed price
would be paid to wind power producers as a feed-in tariff. For instance, at a
EUR 50/MWh market price, the premium guaranteed by the feed-in tariff
would be EUR 33.5/MWh. The tariff levels would be somewhat higher in the
initial stage of the scheme order to facilitate the rapid launch of investments.
The feed-in tariff is expected to further the construction of wind power in
line with the Long-term Climate and Energy Strategy, the objective of which

Electricité de France plans to obtain 300,000 TEMPO subscribers by the end of 1996.
In the medium term, market surveys suggest that the new pricing system could be of interest
to about a million homes by the year 2000. In terms of consumption, the TEMPO tariff would
then represent 5.4 TWh by the year 2000; the reduction in peak electricity consumption could
reach 1.5 TWh, equivalent to a reduction of about 0.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions a

Alongside the traditional individual wood heating sector, nearly 1,000 urban or collective boiler rooms have developed that use wood as their main energy source. In total, wood heating makes it possible to avoid about 10 million tonnes of CO2 (8). 
Since 1994, ADEME has been effectively supporting the development of collective boiler rooms in eleven regions (then in all regions from 1999) through investment subsidies (up to about 50%) with the regional councils, as well as improving the energy performance and use of individual equipment, in particular through the promotion of the Flamme Verte mark for equipment and the NF firewood mark.

technical and economic developments. They are guided by the principle of ensuring the minimum
profitability required for the deployment of these technologies.
To achieve its targets regarding renewable energy production, the Government uses two main types of
mechanisms: open-access schemes and tendering procedures.","https://unfccc.int/documents/64738",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"
"378","France","FRA","NC7",NA,"Open-window schemes","The open-access mechanism confers the right to benefit from support for any eligible installation. This
mechanism is adapted for mature sectors for which production costs are relatively known and stable, and
for which there are many potential development sites with limited conflicts of use. Two open-access
support mechanisms can be identified, depending on the size of the facility: the purchasing obligation
and the additional compensation scheme.
The purchasing obligation has only been applied to small facilities since 2016. Any kilowatt-hour injected
onto the public network is purchased by an obligated buyer at a feed-in tariff exceeding the average
market price level, set in advance and enabling the costs of its installation to be covered while ensuring
normal project profitability.","https://unfccc.int/documents/64738",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"
"379","France","FRA","NC7",NA,"Tendering procedures","In tendering procedures, support is only allocated to parties awarded with contracts under these
procedures (e.g. calls for tender). These systems are suitable for renewable energy sectors that have
one of the following characteristics: need for supervision due to the risk of usage conflicts (e.g. in the
case of high-capacity biomass); lack of suitable areas (e.g. offshore wind power); highly asymmetric cost
information; technological demonstration and industrial development issues. Tendering procedures
improve competitiveness in renewable energy development by placing projects in competition with one
another, and are suitable tools for controlling renewable energy development trajectories in accordance
with the targets set by the PPE (multi-year energy programme). When the capacity targets set by the
PPE have not been attained, the minister in charge of energy has the option of initiating tendering
procedures to develop new production capacities. Winning projects can benefit both from a feed-in tariff
and from an additional compensation scheme, depending on the installed capacity of the projects and
the procedure’s bill of specifications. 

The law of February 10, 2000 on the modernization and development of the public electricity service allows for the launch of calls for tenders in order to achieve the objectives set out in the multi-year investment program for electricity production. In the field of renewable energies, calls for tenders have been launched in the biomass and wind power sectors.","https://unfccc.int/documents/64738",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"

purchasing obligation","Support is provided for renewable energy in the gas sector via the following mechanisms:
 open-access schemes: any biogas producer wishing to inject its product into the natural gas
transport and distribution networks is eligible for an open-access purchasing obligation, provided
that this has no adverse effect on the proper operation of the networks. In this system, the injected
biogas is purchased by a natural gas supplier at a pre-set feed-in tariff covering the biogas
production plant investment and operating costs, while ensuring normal project profitability. The
purchasing obligation is contracted for a period of 15 years.

meet the targets calculated in the multiannual energy plan, the Minister in charge of energy may
issue a call for tenders.

The first open call for tenders for 200 MWe of biomass and 50 MWe of biogas concerned the construction before January 1, 2007 of power generation plants of more than 12 MWe. Out of the 23 candidates declared, 14 biomass projects (216 MWe) and 1 biogas project (16 MWe) were selected, for an average selling price of 86 €/MWh.

To achieve these objectives, the Government has introduced a new planning instrument called
multiannual energy plan (French: PPE) which sets quantitative goals for each renewable source over a
period of 10 years (except for the initial period, which covers 2016-2023). The PPE will be reviewed every

The measures covered by the decree are: building shells, replacement of heating plants with more efficient ones and replacement or installation of equipment using renewable energy.
The incentives are identified based on the energy saving achievable for the building and on energy production from renewable sources.
At the beginning of 2016, a revision of the Thermal/Heat Account has been introduced. The new legislation is now fully complementary to the Tax deductions (described below). In addition to the introduction of new energy efficiency measures, the scope of eligible subjects has been expanded and the size of eligible plants has been increased. In addition, the direct access procedure was simplified, the incentive disbursement period decreased, and the one-off payment limit increased.

The agreement includes the establishment of energy management systems in order to enable companies to monitor their energetic performance. For this purpose, companies are committed to collect data on energy consumption and corresponding output figures in order to generate “energy efficiency indicators”. Moreover, energy audits shall be introduced to disclose energy efficiency potentials in the production processes. In cooperation with the, at that time, Energy Agency (now Energieagence), the FEDIL agreed to conduct information campaigns to raise its members‟ awareness of the issue of energy efficiency and renewable energy use.
In April 2005, a target for the improvement of energy efficiency in the industrial sector was introduced into the voluntary agreement. The FEDIL and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and External Trade as well as the Ministry of the Environment finally agreed upon the adoption of a minimum improvement of energy efficiency of 15% in the time period between 1990 and 2005. In February 2007, the voluntary agreement was amended again and new efficiency targets were introduced. According to the amended agreement FEDIL members accept an energy improvement target of 16% in the time period between 1990 and 2006 and 17% between 1990 and 2007. End 2008, the agreement was renewed again and comprises now a minimum improvement of energy efficiency of 20% in the time period between 1990 and 2010.

through the use of natural gas, is one of the
measures being implemented. The first supplies
of natural gas to the public were delivered in
the first quarter of 1997.
During the first few years of use of this fuel,
around 40% of consumption will be used for
electricity production, and the first gas fired
powered station is expected to come into
operation in 1998, followed by alteration works
to be carried out on already existing power
stations for mixed burning operations.
The increased demand for electricity projected
for the year 2010 will therefore essentially be
fulfilled by natural gas.
The projections suggest that natural gas will
be used as a replacement fuel for other, more
polluting fuels. This will represent around 10%
in industry and 11% in the domestic/services
sector by the year 2010. The consumption of natural gas in Portugal
in the years 2000 and 2010 is expected to
represent around 8% and 14% of the total
consumption of primary energy, respectively.
The introduction of natural gas has benefited
from the support of the Energy Programme, both
in respect of the building of transport and
distribution infrastructures as in actions designed
to further the penetration of gas on the market,
particularly as regards reconversion to
consumption of natural gas.","https://unfccc.int/documents/198743",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"

from an overall reduction target of 10%, emissions from heating/process fuels are to be lowered by
15% and emissions from transport fuels by 8%. In lowering fossil fuel consumption, priority is to
be given to voluntary action. However, if voluntary and other CO 2 -related measures do not suffice,
the Federal Council is authorized to resort to an incentive tax. The tax rates depend on the
shortfalls in meeting the sectoral targets and require the approval of Parliament. Net revenues are to
be fully redistributed to the population on a per-capita basis and to businesses as a percentage of
wages paid. The need for a CO 2 tax is determined by means of energy projection models (see
Section 5.1.1). In assessing how far CO2 reduction targets have been met, all relevant measures in
other policy sectors are to be taken into account. The CO2 Act allows for the use of flexible
mechanisms supplemental to domestic action. The implementation of this provision is regulated in

cent for heat generation, by the year 2000. At the same time, the production of
hydropower was to be increased by 5 per cent and the capacity of existing nuclear
plant by 10 per cent. The ‘Energy 2000’ programme induced many activities (not specially described
here), such as energy management (for instance in hospitals), energy audits in companies,
supporting the use of renewable energy, encouraging energy efficiency, information
partnership in the building sector, energy saving services for small and medium enterprises,
optimisation of construction technologies. „Energy 2000“ is based on the following
three principles.
1. Voluntary measures for the efficient use
of energy and for the use of renewable
forms of energy.
2. State framework conditions for a supply
of energy which is sufficient, safe, and
acceptable economically and
environmentally, and also for a non-
wasteful, efficient use of energy.
3. Discussion of controversial themes (e.g
nuclear energy, measures for saving
energy) with interest groups and those
affected.
„Energy 2000“ is based on partnership with
all spheres affected. Cantons, communes,
business and private individuals promote
energy efficiency and the use of renewable
sources of energy through voluntary
measures and with financial contributions.","https://unfccc.int/documents/198770",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"

The Act specifies that the UK must reduce its emissions by at least 80% by 2050 relative to
1990 levels (the international baseline) and by at least 34% by 2020. The Act requires carbon
budgets be set providing a framework for meeting our statutory targets by setting a maximum

The Act established the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) – an independent body that
advises the government on emissions targets, and reports to Parliament on progress made in
reducing GHG emissions, which the Government is required to respond to.
Scotland has set targets to reduce Scottish emissions of greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050

or transport it for safe permanent storage in saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields. It is
the only approach that has the potential to turn high carbon fuels into genuinely low carbon

The UK government believes CCUS could play a significant role in low carbon electricity

"1316","United Kingdom","GBR","NC7",NA,"Non-Domestic Green Deal and energy efficiency","The Sixth National Communication reported on the establishment of the Green Deal, which
enables consumers to take out loans to pay for energy efficiency improvements in their
properties, with repayments made through their energy bill. Repayments are made on a Pay-
As-You-Save (PAYS) basis: after the improvement has been made, the consumer begins to save
energy, their energy bills are less than they would have been without the improvement, and
these savings are used to repay the loan.
The National Communication reported some early interest in the Green Deal. At that stage,
there had been over 100,000 Green Deal Assessments in properties (the first step before taking
out a Green Deal loan). The initial interest was in domestic properties, and the Government
had envisaged that the non-domestic Green Deal market would take longer than the domestic
market to develop.
In the event, uptake across both sectors was significantly below expectations. In July 2015,
the Government announced there would be no further public investment in the scheme. The
Framework set up to support the programme, however, remained in place to service existing
Green Deal Plans and for any private finance providers wishing to enter the market.
The Government is now considering options for the future of the Green Deal Framework in the
light of a number of factors. There may be several reasons why the uptake of the Green Deal
was below expectations, and the Government will learn from these. The Government believes,
however, that the PAYS mechanism at the heart of the Green Deal could still play a valuable role,
in both the domestic and non-domestic market. A key factor for optimism that PAYS can play
a role is the interest from a number of finance providers, not least from the new owners of the
Green Deal Finance Company, which was the vehicle originally created to finance Green Deal
loans and in which the Government ended public investment during 2015.
In October 2017, the Government launched a “Call for Evidence on the reform of the Green Deal
Framework”. The outcomes of this call for evidence will help to inform Government decisions on
the future of the Green Deal, including for the non-domestic sector.","https://unfccc.int/documents/198292",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"

"1318","United Kingdom","GBR","NC7",NA,"Energy from waste","The incineration of energy from waste (EfW) is supported under the RHI through the biomass
tariff and so links to the energy supply section. The RHI pays a tariff for the proportion of
heat generated from the biomass in municipal solid waste (MSW), which is typically 50% or
higher. Currently, other types of waste, such as commercial and industrial waste are excluded.
However, other types of waste are supported under the Renewables Obligation (RO).
Energy from waste has the dual benefit of producing renewable energy and avoiding harmful
CH4 emissions when the biodegradable proportion of this waste decays in landfill. The main
input fuels for incineration are currently waste collected by local authorities , commercial and
industrial waste, and in some cases construction and demolition waste.
The Government wishs to align the RO with the RHI and not present additional barriers to
participants already complying with the RO requirements. It will therefore extend support
under the RHI to energy from commercial and industrial wastes where not more than 90% of
the waste is, or is derived, from fossil fuel (i.e. waste has a biomass content of at least 10%).

"1362","United Kingdom","GBR","NC6",2012,"Energy Efficiency Stategy: the Energy Efficiency Opportunity in the UK","The government’s Energy Efficiency Strategy: the Energy Efficiency Opportunity in the UK,72

efficiency the UK could be saving 196 TWh in 2020.73 Our existing policy package should save
the UK 154 TWh in 2020.
The Energy Efficiency Strategy identified four key barriers to the deployment of cost-effective
energy efficiency investments in the UK economy:
Embryonic markets: The UK already has an energy efficiency market but it is small relative to
the size of the opportunity. There are significant economic benefits to be realised from growing
this market and making energy efficiency a mainstream activity.
Information: There is currently a lack of access to trusted and appropriate energy efficiency
information. Where information is available it may be generic and not tailored to specific
circumstances, which means that enterprises are not able to fully assess the benefits of an
energy efficiency investment.
Misaligned financial incentives: Those investing in energy efficiency measures are not always
the ones receiving the direct benefit. For example, the wider benefits of energy efficiency
investment, such as improved security of supply and reduced carbon emissions, are not always
realised by those making the investment.
Undervaluing energy efficiency: Partly as a result of the lack of trusted information,
the long-term benefits of improved energy efficiency are often regarded as less certain.
Consequently, energy efficiency is undervalued relative to other investment options and not
prioritised as it might otherwise be.
Over the last twelve months, the UK has made good progress towards overcoming these
barriers. The introduction of new policies and the simplification of existing ones has resulted
in: expanded choice and support for households; simplified and extended support for UK
businesses and the public sector; improved access to financing for energy efficiency measures;
and improved awareness of the benefits of energy efficiency.","https://unfccc.int/documents/198423",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"

report entitled Determination Analysis of Energy Conservation Standards for Distribution
Transformers, which was peer reviewed by manufacturers of transformers, steel, and
aluminum and by utilities, associations, and energy-conservation public interest groups.
The report revealed that all energy-conservation cases that were analyzed are technically
feasible, appear to be economically justified, and have the potential for significant energy
savings. Based on the energy conservation cases analyzed, the potential savings range
from 3.6 to 13.7 cumulative quads over the period 2000–2030. The study methodology
consisted of four major elements: development of a data base, development of
conservation options, assessments of energy-conservation options, and incorporation of
feedback from stakeholders. DOE plans to publish a determination notice this year of its
decision as to whether efficiency standards are warranted for distribution transformers.","https://unfccc.int/documents/198779",NA,NA,NA,"UNFCCC National Communications"

transmission and distribution losses will decrease the amount of electricity that needs to be
generated to meet electricity demands, thus reducing CO2 emissions.
The United States is implementing an ENERGY STAR® labeling program to
encourage electric utilities to invest in high-efficiency transformers that reduce transformer
losses. Participating utilities agree to purchase only qualifying equipment designated with
the ENERGY STAR® logo and to accelerate the replacement of higher-loss transformers

""Based on the policies stipulated in the Strategic Energy Plan, which the Cabinet approved in April 2014, METI established the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Subcommittee under the Strategic Policy Committee of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy in order to consider a future vision of a realistic, yet well-balanced energy supply and demand structure. So far, a total of 11 meetings on these matters have been held.
""METI has approved the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook based on the report compiled by the subcommittee.""
The energy and demand outlook for 2030 serves as de facto energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. For renewable energy, it is described that Japan will aim to increase the share of renewables in total electricity generation to 22-24% by 2030. For energy efficiency, it is described that Japan will aim to reduce its final energy use by about 10%, from 361 million kl crude oil equivalent (coe) in 2010 to 326 million kl coe in 2030.
Original title: ????????????. For the primary energy supply, the envision structure for FY2030 is as follows: renewables 13-14%,Nuclear power: 10-11%, Natural gas: 18%, Coal: 25%, LPG: 3%, Oil 30%. For the power source mix, the structure is for FY2030 is as follows: Renewables: 22-24%, Nuclear power 20-22%, LNG: 27%, Coal: 26%, Oil 3%. Renewables are divided into: Geothermal: 1-1.1%; Biomass: 3.7-4.6%, Wind: 1.7%; Solar: 7%; Hydro: 8.8-9.2%. With a projection of economic growth at 1.7%/year, energy efficiency and conservation measures are also expected to allow a 196.1 bn kWh reduction (reduction of 17%).
Japan's INDC is developed based on this Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook.

The Law introduces several development schemes for the private development of renewable energy projects, including competitive bids, feed-in tariff, and independent power production through third party access.
Competitive bidding to be run by the New and Renewable Energy Authority (“NREA”) open to private sector companies for construction of the renewable power projects. Constructed stations will be operated by NREA. Produced electricity will be sold to Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) at a regulated price determined by Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency (ERA).
Competitive bidding mechanism for build-own-operate (BOO) contracts to be run by EETC and open to private companies for construction, ownership and operation of the renewable power projects. Generated electricity will be sold to EETC on the price agreed between EETC and plant owner.
Feed-in tariff (FIT) support system under which private sector investors are allowed to build, own and operate renewable energy power stations and sell generated electricity to EETC or to licensed distribution companies via power purchase agreements (PPA). PPA determines duration of the contract and a fix electricity price (feed-in tariff). PPA for feed-in tariffs for solar installations will last 20 years, for wind projects 25 years. Egypt aims to deploy 4300 MW of new renewable capacity under FIT scheme between 2015 and 2017. FIT system is open only for solar PV and wind technologies.
Independent power production through third party access scheme allows independent power producers (IPP) to enter bilateral electricity purchase contracts with eligible consumers and sell them produced electricity directly. EETC must allow for conclusion of such contract and make grid network available. In this case, EETC is allowed to charge and collect greed access fee for grid usage.","https://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-renewable-energy-law-review-edition-3/1229892/egypt",NA,2015,NA,"Climate Policy Database"

To reach such targets, the solar policy includes a combination of support tools: First, power producers are exempted from electricity duty on the energy they consume and can apply for incentives under the Industry Scheme. Producers of solar thermal energy are granted access to the water quantity required for generation by local authorities and solar power will be guaranteed grid access under both the Indian Solar Mission and the Rajasthan Solar policy. The solar policy seeks to widespread the installation of solar water heating systems on all industrial buildings where hot water is required, large residential buildings, government and private hospitals, hotels and swimming pools. Solar steam systems in residential institutions and hospitals will also be supported. Second, the solar policy creates the RE infrastructure Development Fund to finance transmission network extension, road construction and ease the integration of RE generation. Such Fund will be financed by the collection of a development charge of INR. 10 Lacs per MW installed transfered to the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. The policy also provides for the regulation framework to develop solar parks larger than 1, 000 MW capacity. Such Parks will include Solar Power Plants, Manufacturing Zones, R & D and Training Centres. Third, the Solar Policy creates the Solar Research Center of excellence. The solar policy will fulfill Rajasthan s engagements in the National Solar Mission -install 66 MW of solar capacity- and install additional capacity following a competitive bidding process. Central government will tender 50 MW of solar PV and 50 MW of solar thermal and best bidders will be guaranteed a fixed price by Discoms of Rajasthan. Moreover, the policy will promote the installation of solar PV and solar thermal plans for direct sale to Discoms of Rajasthan with a maximum capacity of 200 MW by 2013 and an additional 400 MW by 2017. Eligible projects will also be selected through auctions. The state will promote off grid and decentralised solar applications and hybrid systems in replacement of diesel based generators. The solar policy also facilitates the installation of solar power producers targeting solar power trade with third party or other states. In fact, Rajasthan aims to become a major issuer of solar Renewable Energy Certificates within the Indian Renewable Portfolio Obligation.","https://energy.rajasthan.gov.in/content/dam/raj/energy/dept_of_energy/pdf/misc/solar_policy.pdf",NA,2011,NA,"Climate Policy Database"

?The government will identify and publish “Development and commercialization status of cutting-edge power generation technologies” by size and by fuel types, as s reference for business operators’ consideration and will request business operators to adopt BATs
(b) Consistency with national targets and plans
b-1: In relation to mid-term target?If the business operator takes actions under the sector-wide framework or plans to take measures including mitigation in abroad to offset the net increase emission over a natural gas power plant, it is judged as consistent with national targets and plans.
b-2: In relation to 2050 target?The government will accelerate development of the technologies which is targeted to be commercialized by around 2020, conduct survey on potential CO2 storage sites as a prerequisite for CCS, identify requirements for CCS Ready plants, and request business operators to study continuously including technological development in order to put carbon capture facilities towards commercialization.

The targets set for 2030 are as follows:
- Double the energy self-sufficiency ratio (18% at present, including nuclear power generation) and the domestically-developed fossil fuel supply ratio* (26% at present), and raise the energy independence ratio to about 70 percent from the present 38 percent.
*The ratio of fossil fuel supply from domestic and overseas interests that a Japanese company has a share in the total supply
- Raise the ratio of energy from zero-emission power sources such as nuclear and renewable energy to 70 percent (by more than 50% in 2020) from the present 34%. For this purpose:
Build more than 14 additional nuclear plants (nine by 2020).
Raise the overall plant capacity utilization rate to 90 percent (85% by 2020) from the 60% in 2008.
Maximize the use of renewable energy.
Cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the residential sector by half.
Maintain and raise energy efficiency in the industrial sector to the highest level in the world.
Maintain or achieve top-level shares of global markets for energy-related products and systems.
According to the plan, the goal is to reduce domestic energy-related CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030 compared to the 1990 level. Its intention was to increase nuclear energy in the mix to raise Japan's level of energy self-sufficiency, on the assumption this would also enhance energy security. (Although Japan imports all the uranium it needs for nuclear power generation, nuclear power was deemed a ""quasi-domestic energy"" because the government considers it possible to recycle nuclear fuel at home, if the nuclear fuel cycle is based on reprocessing used fuel and using it in fast-breeder reactors.)

It will be accomplished in three stages: the first is a major overhaul of the energy sector; the second emphasizes efficiency gains through new technology within the fuel and energy sectors; and the third stresses economy-wide energy efficiency. The targets for each phase for the various indicators can be found in Annex 3 of the document. To be updated by Energy Strategy of Russia to 2035. A draft of the updated strategy, Energy Strategy Plan to 2035 is currently under review.

Croatian National Energy Strategy 2009-2020 has three basic objectives: 1) increase security of energy supply, 2) develop competitive energy system and 3) ensure sustainable energy sector development. These objectives are particularly important due to Croatia’s heavy dependence on energy imports which results in country’s vulnerability to energy prices volatilities.
Targets:
- decrease by 20% greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 taking emissions level of 1990 as a baseline;
- increase share of renewable energy by 20% in annual gross energy consumption of the country by 2020;
- cover 10% of energy consumption in all transport sector with energy derived from renewable sources by 2020;
- decrease final energy consumption by 9% by 2016.

The NEP also calls for a revival of Nigeria’s coal sector, which currently provides a negligible contribution to the country’s energy supply. The policy targets a 30% share of coal in the country’s energy mix, which we assume refers to the power mix. While the government has handed out 36 coal mining licences tied to 10,000 MW of coal capacity, none of the projects have been successful (Daily Trust, 2019).

Some of the main actions envisioned in the Doctrine are setting a price on carbon, and enhancing energy efficiency and the expansion of renewables and alternative energy sources.
The energy targets presented in the Doctrine are: to reduce the share of energy generated from natural gas to 46% or 47% by 2030 (from more than 50% currently); doubling the capacity of nuclear power plants; increase the share of electricity produced from renewables to 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020; and limit the burning of gas produced from oil wells. RE target of 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020 was superseded in 2014 by the State Program on Energy efficiency and Energy Development. Followed by the Comprehensive Plan for Implementation of the Climate Doctrine to 2020.
National, regional and local authorities are responsible for producing and implementing action plans that are in line with the Doctrine, creating fiscal and financial incentives for the development and deployment of technologies that enhance energy efficiency, and lead to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, the responsibility to adopt measures that lead to energy efficiency in vehicles, building, services and the production of heat and electricity rest with the enterprises themselves.

In 2000, it was revised and a new price at which a utility or supplier has to purchase renewable electricity from private generators was fixed. It ranges from € 0.03/kWh (for secondary biomass) to € 0.39/kWh (for PV under 5 kW). From 1999, wind electricity producers could receive either a fixed tariff of € 0.06/kWh or the average hourly market price of electricity plus a bonus of € 0.03/kWh. Rates are specified for both capacity and output credits. Output credits are the highest for wind and solar plants: € 0.07/kWh over a five-year period. Capacity credits are the highest for waste incineration plants; output credits for these plants vary depending on the size of the plant and on the relative importance of any co-fired fossil fuel. They also decrease annually. Buy-back rates for these plants are about € 0.06/kWh in the first year. Buy-back rates also depend on continuity of supply to avoid surges in power sold to the grid.

In the reference year its emissions were 102.74 KtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) which has been decreasing during the 2000s, reaching 86,93 KtCO2e in 2018. There is no agriculture sector in the country. Monaco has set the goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050. For this, Monaco is setting efforts embedded in a national policy framework.
In the electricity sector, the goal is to reduce consumption of fossil fuels, so Monaco is trying to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise energy, investing in solar thermal and PV and geothermal networks. In buildings, also, the replacement of fossil fuels to biofuels is being incentivised, as well as, increasing environmental performance and energy efficiency of the buildings using sustainable codes and methods of construction and financial mechanisms for renovations. In the transport sector, Monaco focuses on the reduction of traffic and decarbonisation of the transport. A shift to other modals and public transportation is supported though electric public transportation. Lastly, the industry sector is weak in Monaco being mainly related to craft and cross sectoral measures about electricity will also cover this sector.
Market mechanisms under the article 6 is a possible outlined in the NDC to be used in the future to achieve the outlined reductions of GHG emissions (Monaco NDC, 2020).

In a first step to completely phase out fossil fuels the government targets the drop in the consumption of oil, gas and coal by 33% between 2009 and 2020.
The share of thermal production in total energy generation should also decrease from 71% to 40% over the same period.
To reach 100% of electricity from renewable, the Danish government greatly focuses on wind energy, expected to provide for 40% of total electricity needs, together with biomass and biogas. A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector.
Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector.
In the building sector, the Danish government is going a step forward in implementing very ambitious building code, banning oil boilers in all new constructions and, by 2017, in all houses while biomass, biogas and solar thermal appliances will be strongly encouraged.
Denmark also targets the large scale deployment of offshore wind as well as dramatic growth in the wind manufacturing sector, and will fund research and development in for solar and wave power, support main demonstration projects for large heat pumps intended to be used in district heating plants and fund other geothermal energy research projects.
In order to generate revenues to finance the energy shift of the country, Denmark will introduce a public service obligation tax on electricity and gas, while tax on oil, gas and coal will be further increased to discourage their use.

This strategy has established targets in the five thematic sectors to be accomplished within a five-year timeline up to 2025.
The Household Sector has two targets. It aims to increase the number of household appliances subjected to Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) from six to ten. It also aims for the use of improved efficient biomass cookstoves at 50 per cent of all households currently using biomass cookstoves.
There are six targets to be met in the Building Sector. First, there should be 10% share of newly built floor area compliant with energy efficiency requirements in the total building stock from the current baseline of zero. Second, two per cent of the buildings should have adopted American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standards for energy efficiency of buildings, or equivalent. Third, energy loads due to lighting in public buildings will be reduced by 50 per cent. Fourth and fifth, 20 per cent of public buildings and 25 per cent of the affordable houses the government is planning to build should be green, respectively. Lastly, the sector should develop Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for buildings.
This strategy has also set two targets for the Industry and Agriculture Sector. The sector is expected to increase the number of energy audits carried out from the current 1,800 to 4,000.  The sector is also expected to implement the recommended energy conservation measures to save 100 MW of power demand, 250 million litres of heavy fuel oil and 9 million litres of industrial diesel oil.
In the Transport Sector, three targets have been set. The first is the improvement of fuel economy. Increasing the share of electric vehicles in the transport sector has been identified as the second target, aiming to reach five per cent. Lastly, NEECS targets to increase the number of passengers using commuter trains from 116,000 to 150,000 per day.
In the Utilities Sector, the strategy identifies the need to reduce transmission and distribution system losses from 23 to 15 per cent.","https://unepdtu.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kenya-national-energy-efficiency-and-conservation-strategy-2020.pdf",NA,2020,NA,"Climate Policy Database"

The ETS will start with the electricity sector covering around 3.5 Gt CO2 emissions (Stavins, 2017) and is expected to start in 2020 (China Carbon Forum, 2017). After that, gradually other industry sectors, such as cement, steel, petroleum refining and chemicals will be added to the program.

The Energy Management Act (Act No. 406/2000), which entered into force in January 2001, and was amended in 2006, established standards for energy efficiency of heat and electricity production, transmission, distribution and use, energy planning requirements, energy auditing obligations, energy auditors certification, an energy labelling programme, energy performance of buildings, and inspection of boilers and air conditioning units. The act incorporates relevant regulations of the European Communities. Council Directive 93/76/EEC of September 1993 to limit CO2 emissions by improving energy effiiciency. Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings. The act sets forth a) certain measures towards enhancing the economical use of energy and the obligations of natural and legal persons managing and using energy, and b) the rules applicable to the formulation of the National Energy Policy, the Territorial Energy Policies and the National Programme for Economical Energy Management and Use of Renewable and Secondary Energy Sources. In 2000, the Czech government approved the new Energy Policy, establishing a target of 5%-6% of TPES from renewable energy by 2010 and 8-10% by 2020, in fitting with the EU Green Paper policy.

The new renewable energy law establishes more ambitious national renewable energy targets that should reach 20% of total national energy consumption and 40% of total electricity consumption by 2020. Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources. The new legislation foresees the creation of a Special Renewable Energy Investment Service that will act as an interface between public institutions and investors, annually assess the main challenges to renewable energy deployment and manage the support funding allocation process. Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills. In fact, the law establishes that a share of the RE concession taxes paid by RE producers to regional and local authorities will will be allocated to local households as a credit on their electricity bill as a way to share the benefits of living nearby a renewable energy generation plant. The renewable energy generation licensing process has also been very much fasten and eased by the regulation that entitles the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) with the assessment and issuance of licences, under the authority of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. The whole licensing process can not last over a 30-month period. Moreover, absolute priority is given to RES projects combined with desalination plants, when and only when the RES project is on an island and its capacity does not exceed 25% of the capacity of the desalination plant. The law also tackles the grid infrastructure challenge and implements a timely limited target for the grid utility to connect non-interconnected islands to the main grid. Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated. The grid utility is compelled to provide grid access within four months after the connection demand has been released. The Law 3851 also establishes a whole new set of feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable sources, to be found in the Greek FIT article.

The National Energy Plan aims to install other sources of energy to achieve a diversification of the basket and ensure a reliable energy supply. The inclusion of wind power plants, photovoltaic solar generation, geothermal energy and generation from the biomass in the country's electric mix is ??sought.
The UPME (Unit of Energy Mining Planning - Unidad de Planeación Minero Energética) identified the possible medium and long-term expansion alternatives that would allow the basket to diversify and have evaluated its impact on the system in the Expansion Reference-Generation and Transmission Plan 2014-2028. Several scenarios were presented. One of the scenarios considers the participation of more than 10% in non-conventional renewable energy in installed capacity by 2028, with a generation that ranges from 2.5% to 7.5% of total production in the period of analysis.
In the most feasible scenario, unconventional sources of energy may account for 6% of the electric energy basket, which would correspond to an installed capacity of 1,207 MW in 2028. In addition to the 474 MW of wind power in the pessimistic scenario, it is considered possible to install 143 MW of solar energy, 275 geothermal and 314 MW of biomass cogeneration.

The law provides a series of tax benefits to new renewable projects (accelerated amortization in income tax, income tax relief in profits re-invested in renewables, VAT refund, fiscal certificates, feed-in tariffs etc.) over a period of 10 years. The law also establishes the Fund for the Development of Renewable Energies (FODER) to support renewables projects. The law covers all main types of renewable sources. The feed-in tariffs previously established through law 26.190 apply to renewable projects sharing electricity into the public grid and have the following values: $0.9/kWh for solar PVs and $0.015/kWh for all other types of renewable energy.","http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=8d1fbf01-aad6-48aa-ab93-2e694a2d0051

The NEP projects electricity demand and supply planning until the fiscal year 2026/27. It has a cumulative target of 175 GW renewable energy capacity by 2022. The NEP foresees coal-fired power capacity additions of 46 GW between 2022 and 2027.
""It is expected that the share of non-fossil based installed capacity (Nuclear + Hydro + Renewable Sources) will increase to 46.8 % by the end of 2021-22 and will further increase to 56.5 % by the end of 2026-27 considering capacity addition of 50,025 MW coal based capacity already under construction and likely to yield benefits during 2017-
22 and no coal based capacity addition during 2022-27."" (http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/committee/nep/nep_dec.pdf)
It implies that no new coal-fired power plants are necessary beyond those already under construction (Carbon Brief, 2017), and further calls of 57% of electric capacity to be non-fossil by 2027 (Carbon Brief, 2017).
Other targets: Renewable energy generation share of 20% by 2022; Renewable energy generation share of 24% by 2027.
Renewable energy sector is now poised for a quantum jump as India has reset its renewable energy capacity addition target so as to have an installed capacity of 175 GW (100GW solar, 60GW wind, 10GW biomass and 5GW small-hydro) by 2022, in view of the significant renewable energy potential in the country and commitment made by the investors/stakeholders.

Energy encompasses both electricity generation and fossil-fuel extraction and production. Industry includes, among others, the automotive, cement, chemicals, glass, steel, metallurgical, mining, and petrochemicals subsectors, as well as the pulp and paper subsector. Only direct CO2 emissions will be regulated through the pilot, and participation is limited to entities with annual emissions greater than 100,000tCO2. The system is expected to cover around 300 entities in this phase, corresponding to approximately 45% of national emissions."" (ICAP 2019)
New Developments: In 2017, Mexico began a simulation of a voluntary Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the General Climate Change Law makes the scheme mandatory as soon as its three-year pilot phase concludes. The pilot phase—originally planned to start in August 2018—started operation in January 2020.

The Strategy comprises three primary 2020 targets:
Over 30% of electricity to be generated from renewable energy sources, mostly from wind power, with biomass, hydro, wave and tidal power playing important roles;
12% of heat to be generated from renewable energy sources, from a large range of sources (biomass, biogas, solar, heat pumps);
10% of transport energy to come from renewable energy sources.
The key measures to achieve the targets are:
An expansion and extension of the Renewables Obligation, requiring energy suppliers to sell larger amounts of renewable energy. New measures to increase financial support for offshore wind will also be considered.
Introducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities.
New guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards. Before the schemes take effect, GBP 45 million in grants have been committed.
The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will be amended or replaced, taking into account sustainability issues, to ensure transport fuels contain a rising amount of renewable biofuels.","https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228866/7686.pdf",NA,2009,2020,"Climate Policy Database"

The renewable electricity is priced at 80% of the generation costs of the utility.
Regulation 12 sets the tariffs for solar, wind, hydro, biomass, biogas, city waste to energy, and geothermal power plants. It stipulates that a renewable tariff is capped at 85% of the electricity supply costs (BPP) for the region in question, and 100% of BPP for geothermal and city waste to energy plants, provided the regional BPP is higher than the national average. If the regional BPP is lower than the national average, then the tariff is capped at 100% of the BPP, unless otherwise agreed in the case of geothermal and city waste to energy plants.

""EU energy security has also to be seen in the context of growing energy demand worldwide, which is expected to increase by 27% by 2030, with important changes to energy supply and trade flows.
Moderating energy demand is one of the most effective tools to reduce the EU's external energy dependency and exposure to price hikes. The current situation adds urgency to the previously agreed EU energy efficiency target of 20% that will result in 371 Mtoe primary energy savings in 2020 compared to projections.""

Currently, the average interconnection level stands at about 8%. Taking into account the importance of interconnectors for strengthening security of supply and the need to facilitate cross-border trade, the European Commission proposes to extend the current 10% interconnection target to 15% by 2030 while taking into account the cost aspects and the potential of commercial exchanges in the relevant regions.""
""In 2012, energy from renewable sources was estimated to have contributed 14.1% of EU final energy consumption and should reach the objective of 20% in 2020. Looking beyond 2020, the Commission has proposed to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27% by 2030.""

• Approximately 1/3 of this capacity will be replaced with natural gas, and 2/3 with renewables (up to 30% of Alberta’s total production).
• In the interim, Alberta will impose a carbon tax of $20 a tonne in 2017, $30 a tonne in 2018, and increasing in real terms after that. For the electricity sector, this will apply to coal-fired emissions above what Alberta’s cleanest natural gas-fired plan would emit for the same amount of electricity production.
In November, 2016, the Government of Alberta announced the first competition for new renewable energy development will begin in early 2017 with the successful bidders awarded at the end of 2017. It will be for up to 400 MW of renewable energy. The Government of Alberta also announced major changes to the electricity system. This includes:
• An electricity price ceiling of 6.8 cents/KWh from June 2017 until June 2021
• Partial re-regulation of the Alberta energy market (details TBA)
• Introduction of a capacity market (paired with the existing generation market), to encourage development of renewable generation. The market will be in place by 2021.
• Plan to introduce Bill 34, the Electric Utilities Amendment Act, would allow the Balancing Pool to borrow money from the province to manage its funding obligations. This change, in conjunction with Ministerial Orders that allow the Balancing Pool to smooth price volatility over a longer period of time, would support electricity costs remaining low and stable.",NA,NA,2015,NA,"Climate Policy Database"

Each year- a predefined (and annually increasing) percentage of electricity supplied to end users has to be covered by green electricity. Suppliers must restitute the necessary number of green certificates to demonstrate that they respect that rule. In case of failure- a penalty fee is due. This situation creates a market for green certificates for the benefit of green electricity producers.  Shares are regularly updated by regional regulation authorities. 3. The final cost of this system is borne by the final consumer through a tariff overload. - The Brussels NECP plans to evaluate the green certicates system in line with the evolution of renewable energy systems cost.

"4075","Sweden","SWE",NA,NA,"Carbon dioxide tax","A carbon dioxide tax, based on the fossil carbon content in the fuel, was in-troduced in 1991 and aims at reducing the emissions of carbon dioxide in sectors outside the EU ETS. The tax has been raised in several steps since it was first implemented. In total, the tax has increased from SEK 0.25/kg (1991) carbon dioxide to SEK 1.20/kg (2021). In addition to specific tax increases stipulated in Government bills, a yearly indexation of the tax level is applied.  

The tax level is proportionate to the calculated amount of carbon dioxide emissions, based on the fuel’s fossil carbon content. This means that biofuels currently are not subject to carbon taxation, if not used within the reduction obligation scheme for motor fuels. With regard to motor fuels, changes to carbon taxation of biofuels were implemented on 1st July 2018 (see separate section on carbon and energy taxation in the transport sector). 

Due to the risk of carbon leakage, a reduced carbon tax is applied for diesel used in agriculture, forestry and aquaculture.

Electricity suppliers are obliged by law to submit electricity certificates corresponding to a certain share, or quota, of their electricity deliveries. The quota is gradually being increased yearly up to 2020 and 2030. Electricity producers are allocated a certificate from the central government for every megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable electricity produced. The producers are allowed to sell the certificates in an open market where the price is set by the seller and buyer. The certificates thereby provide extra profit for the producers of renewable electricity (SFS 2011:1200). 

The rapid development with regard to the expansion of renewable electricity production has led to the electricity certificate system now fulfills a limited function.

It also created a funding programme for GHG neutral heat generation and use.   The schedule is as follows: - Reach 15 GW of hard coal and 15 GW of lignite power generation capacity in 2022- Reach 8 GW of hard coal and 9 GW of lignite power generation capacity in 2030- The rest must be decommissioned by 2038.  The law stipulates several years in which the government will evaluate whether the decommissioning can be moved up to 2035.  The first tendering phase for hard-coal power plants phase-out took place in September 2020 and 11 bids were awarded a total amount of 4.8 GW, to be closed by the end of the year. The German government also committed to cover a total of 4.35 billion EUR in payments to utilities for the country's operators of lignite-fired power plants. This would accelerate the shutdown of their assets and waive operator's rights for future lawsuits once they agree to receive the payments. A second tendering phase took place in January 2021, with a volume of 1,500 MW.

Article 127, for example, specifies that fees can be charged for negative impact on the environment. Under this provision, operators can be charged a fee for emissions of pollutants into the atmospheric air, in particular methane. The rates of payment for the negative impact on the environment are established by the tax legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan.In accordance with Article 111 of the Environmental Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the presence of an integrated environmental permit is mandatory for objects of category I. Category of facilities depends on the gross emissions, as well as on the types of activities. Facilities with gross emissions of 1000 tons and more are assigned to Category I. An integrated environmental permit is a document that includes information on technological standards, environmental emission standards, measures to improve energy efficiency and energy saving, and other things. An integrated environmental permit is obtained subject to the use of one or more of the best available techniques (approved by the Government on the basis of reference books on the best available techniques) to achieve the specified range of emissions.The development of reference books on BAT is carried out by the subordinate organisation of the authorised body in the field of environmental protection - NJSC ""International Center for Green Technologies and Investment Projects"" (ICGTIP), which performs the functions of the BAT Bureau. In 2021, ICGTIP carried out work on the development of 4 reference books on BAT:Intersectoral reference book on BAT ""Combustion of fuel at large installations for the purpose of energy production"";Reference book on BAT ""Oil and gas processing"";Reference book on BAT ""Production of cement and lime"";Reference book on BAT ""Production of inorganic chemicals"".Work is planned for the development of 4 more directories in 2022:Reference book on BAT ""Oil and gas production"";Reference book on BAT ""Extraction and enrichment of ferrous metal ores"";Reference book on BAT ""Utilization, neutralization and disposal of waste, including thermal method"";Reference book on BAT ""Extraction and enrichment of non-ferrous metal ores (including precious)""The BAT principles should be gradually introduced in 10 years. If enterprises do not switch to BAT, then the rates of payment for emissions will grow: from 2025 they will grow 2 times, from 2028 - 4 times and from 2031 - 8 times. At the first stage, it is planned to transfer 50 large enterprises of the oil and gas, mining and metallurgical, chemical and electric power industries to the “best available techniques” (BAT). Those 50 large enterprises account for 80% of the total pollution.In accordance with Article 186 of the Code, operators are required to monitor the quantity, quality of emissions and their changes. The results of this monitoring must be reported to the government. Monitoring of emissions into the environment at Category I facilities should include the use of an “automated system for monitoring emissions into the environment”. The ASM monitors the indicators of emissions into the environment at the main stationary sources of emissions.

"4231","Germany","DEU",NA,NA,"Germany's Renewables Energy Act","As of 14 December 2020, Germany's ruling coalition agreed modifications to its energy law to create the legal basis for continuing the expansion of renewable energy in the long term and help the country meet its goal of producing 65% of its electricity from clean sources from 2030.  The law came into force as of 1 January 2021. It seeks to help ensure that both electricity supply and electricity consumption become carbon-neutral before 2050. To this end, the law specifies the pace at which sustainable energy such as wind and photovoltaics are to be expanded over the next few years.  For the first time, the 2021 Renewable Energy Sources Act provides for annual monitoring, which can be used to make adjustments if necessary. Germany’s renewable energy levy, the surcharge in consumers’ electricity bills that goes to support renewables, will be EUR 0.065 (USD 0.077) per kWh next year, reduced from EUR 0.06756 in 2020. Average households will see power prices fall by 1%. German consumers can look forward to lower energy bills next year after a reduction in a surcharge they pay to support renewable power. The transmission grid companies -- which include Elia’s 50Hertz, Dutch Tennet, EnBW’s Transnet BW and Amprion -- said the cap on the surcharge at 6.5 cents would require 10.8 billion euros of federal support payments.  The government also decided that the fee would fall further to 6.0 cents in 2022 to relieve customers from cost burdens in the fight against the economic fallout from the coronavirus. The Federal Cabinet passed the amendment to the Renewable Energy Sources Act, the so-called EEG amendment 2021. The amendment to the Federal Requirements Plan Act with regulations on the expansion of the electricity grid was also passed in the cabinet. Update 26 November 2021:In order to meet its renewable energy targets, the Federation and the Länder established a new Bund/Länder Cooperation Committee under the Renewable Energy Sources Act.According to a new report published by the Federation and the Länder, the targets are not to be fulfilled if new wind-power projects are not approved. The amount of land dedicated to onshore wind farms is not sufficient to meet the 2030 target, which amounts to 71 GW of installed capacity and for annual auction volumes.","https://www.iea.org/policies/12392-germanys-renewables-energy-act",2021,NA,NA,"IEA"

Building renovation should speed up the integration of renewables in particular from local sources, and promote broader use of waste heat. It should integrate energy systems at local and regional levels helping to decarbonise transport as well as heating and cooling; -Life-cycle thinking and circularity. Minimising the footprint of buildings requires resource efficiency and circularity combined with turning parts of the construction sector into a carbon sink, for example through the promotion of green infrastructure and the use of organic building materials that can store carbon, such as sustainably-sourced wood; -High health and environmental standards.

The law provides:(a) Timing and quotas. The first annual quota should be established by the Cabinet Ministers of Ukraine (the ""Government"") for the year 2020. The annual quota should be proposed by the Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry following consultations with the electricity transmission system operator (Ukrenergo) and the State Agency on Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving of Ukraine (SAEE).The quotas should be established for a five-year term. Until 1 December 2019, the Government should approve the amount of the quota for the next five-year term. Not less than 15% of annual quota will be introduced for each of (i) solar, (ii) wind and, cumulatively, (iii) other types of renewable energy sources, while the remaining quota will be allocated amongst different sources by the Government.State support can be granted for no more than 80% of the total capacity offered by all participants of the auction.One business entity (individually or together with other business entities owned by the same beneficial owner) may not obtain more than 25% of the annual quota auctioned in the relevant year.Auctions will be conducted twice a year, no later than 1 April and 1 October of each year. The auctions will be carried out until 31 December 2029. Pilot auctions are to be carried out in 2019 within six (6) months of the Law coming into effect i.e. 22 November 2019.(b) The ""cut-off"" date for signing ""pre-PPA"" to obtain the feed-in tariff. The ""cut-off"" date for signing ""pre-PPAs"" (preliminary power purchase agreements) so as to be eligible for the feed-in tariff (the ""FiT"") is 31 December 2019. Producers will be exempt from auctions, provided that the commissioning (putting into operation) of a project occurs within two (2) years following the signing of the ""pre-PPA"" for solar power projects, or within three (3) years following the signing of the ""pre-PPA"" for all other sources of energy.If a producer signs a ""pre-PPA"" before then, it will be entitled to the FiT and exempt from auctions, irrespective of the capacity of a project.To sign the ""pre-PPA"", it will be necessary to submit several documents including confirmation of the producer's land rights, a construction permit (or a declaration of the commencement of construction works, as the case may be), as well as a grid connection agreement. This is in line with the Law of Ukraine ""On the Electricity Market"", and marks a shift from the current approach, where a producer need only submit its corporate documents, and can enter into a ""pre-PPA"" even before acquiring land rights and obtaining a construction permit.(c) FiT. The FiT support mechanism, where applicable, will remain in effect until 2030, as contemplated by current legislation. The FiT for new wind projects commissioned in 2020 will be reduced by approximately 10%, and then further reduced for projects commissioned in 2025 as provided for by current legislation.The Law provides for a greater reduction of the FiT for solar power plants compared with the previous legislation. With the current 2019 FiT taken as the general reference basis, the FiT is to be reduced by 25% for solar power projects which will be commissioned in 2020 (instead of a 10% reduction previously contemplated).During the next four (4) years – 2021-2024 – the FiT will be reduced by 2.5% annually compared with the initial 2019 FiT reference basis, or by ca. 3.4 %-3.8 %","https://www.iea.org/policies/6529-ukraine-law-on-renewable-energy-auctions-law-no-2712-viii",2019,NA,NA,"IEA"

Project developers then compete in a reverse auction where the lowest cost renewable energy projects that meet qualifying standards are selected to receive a feed-in premium subsidy (Government of Estonia, 2018b). The 2018 Electricity Market Act amendments define the process for the government to organise public tenders with the following objectives:tenders to increase renewable generation to meet the 2020 target of 17.6% renewable electricity, limited to projects of over 1 MWtenders to increase renewable generation by 5 GWh per year from 2019 to 2021, limited to projects of 50 kW to 1 MWtenders for renewable generation to meet obligations stemming from any statistical transfers of renewable energy established under the EU flexible collaboration mechanismtenders for renewable generation to meet to any targets established by the government beyond 2020.The government is planning for technology-neutral auctions that allow bids from wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, biogas and biomass projects. 3 Qualifying projects selected through the auction process receive monthly payments for generating electricity from renewable sources, which are calculated as a sliding premium on top of the market price for electricity.The premium is equal to EUR 0.0537 per kWh, which is paid on top of the average electricity market price of the last month. The premium is reduced if the average price rises above EUR 0.0393/kWh and reaches zero once the average price is above EUR 0.093/kWh. The sliding premium is guaranteed for 12 years if the project generates the agreed amount of renewable electricity (Government of Estonia, 2018b).This subsidy scheme encourages project developers to bid by guaranteeing auction winners a minimum payment of EUR 0.0537 per kWh even if the average market price for electricity is very low, or even zero. But it also exposes producers to some market signals as the premium decreases when market prices go up, and the risk of overpayment is eliminated as the premium is gradually reduced to zero if electricity prices increase.The renewable support scheme established under the 2018 Electricity Market Act amendments maintains a non-competitive feed-in premium for wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, biogas or biomass projects with a capacity of less than 50 kW. Qualifying projects do not have to participate in auctions, but automatically receive a payment calculated as a sliding premium on top of the market price for electricity delivered to the grid. Payments are calculated using the same floating market premium formula described above, but projects qualifying for the non-competitive feed-in premium are not required to generate any set amount of electricity.Funding for the renewable support scheme continues to come from a renewable energy charge that supported the previous feed-in premium system. Every electricity customer in Estonia pays this charge, which is collected by Elering, the transmission system operator. There are no exemptions or reductions. In 2019, the charge was EUR 0.0104/kWh.","https://www.iea.org/policies/6545-estonia-amendments-to-the-electricity-market-act-establishing-reverse-auctions-and-sliding-premium",2018,NA,NA,"IEA"

Feed-in tariffs are not supposed to cover the entire unit technical cost of electricity from a particular energy source.Feed-in tariff are available for the following technologies: hydropower (installed capacity between 1 and 10 megawatts; exceptions for plants with less than 1 megawatt installed capacity may apply); photovoltaics (>30 kW); wind energy; geothermal energy; and biomass.The tariffs for power from renewable sources are based on reference power plants for each technology and output category. The tariff is applicable for 15-20 years (10 years for biomass infrastructure power plants). In view of technological progress and the increasing degree of market maturity of new technologies, the tariff rates are subject to a regular review. Reductions only apply to new production facilities that are put into operation.The feed-in tariff system expires for new plants that come online on or after 1.1.2024. Small (<30 kW) photovoltaics plants receive investment aids (and no longer a feed-in tariff). There are investment aids for hydropower plants with an installed capacity larger than 10 megawatts. There are also investment aids for biomass-plants, The promotion system is financed by a grid surcharge for renewable energies, which is capped by law at 2.3 Swiss cent/kWh (CHF 1.2 billion Swiss Francs per year). Due to great demand and the limited amount of funds, there is a long waiting list.Other Measures: Besides the FiT and the investment aids, there are other measures that are financed by the grid surcharge:  Hydropower remediation aims at compensating the costs of remediation measures to be implemented by existing hydropower plants to prevent or eliminate the effects of hydropeaking and change of bed load budget or to ensure passability for migrant fish.

It also aims at reducing the variability in renewable power generation and achieving better grid stability. On technology front, the Policy provides for integration of both the energy sources i.e. wind and solar at AC as well as DC level. The Policy also provides for flexibility in share of wind and solar components in hybrid project, subject to the condition that, rated power capacity of one resource be at least 25% of the rated power capacity of other resource for it to be recognised hybrid project.The Policy seeks to promote new hybrid projects as well as hybridisation of existing wind/solar projects. The existing wind/solar projects can be hybridised with higher transmission capacity than the sanctioned one, subject to availability of margin in the existing transmission capacity.The Policy provides for procurement of power from a hybrid project on tariff-based transparent bidding process for which Government entities may invite bids. The policy also permits use of battery storage in the hybrid project for optimising the output and further reduces the variability. It mandates the regulatory authorities to formulate necessary standards and regulations for wind-solar hybrid systems.With significant capacity additions in renewables in recent years and with Hybrid Policy aiming at better utilisation of resources, it is envisaged that the Hybrid Policy will open-up a new area for availability of renewable power at competitive prices along with reduced variability.

Quotas are being established for the year 2018 and year 2020. The new system assigns electricity users including grid companies, electricity retail companies, and large end-users participating in direct power purchasing a percentage quota of their electricity that needs to come from renewable energy. Users can prove they have fulfilled the obligations by buying renewable energy certificates (RECs), which are issued to renewable generators for each megawatt-hour (MWh) they produce. There will be separate renewable obligations for hydropower and other renewable energy (wind, solar, biomass). Users with an insufficient number of RECs at the year-end will be obligated to buy replacement RECs at a price proposed by power grid enterprises and filed with the National Development and Reform Commission. The calculation of quota considers several factors. They include are newly added renewable power installed capacity and electricity, renewable curtailment rates, inter-regional and inter-provincial power transmission capacity, power load estimation and market trading volume. For provinces which do not achieve the quota, the energy administrative departments will cut or temporarily postponed provincial fossil power construction quota, and they are not able to apply demonstration projects. For market users which do not achieve the quota, the government will cancel or reduce the amount of allowed market trading volume for the next year.

While the benchmark is constant across NSW, the targets are varied to suit regional climates and can be amended over time to achieve State objectives for water and greenhouse gas savings. Variable targets that recognise differences in local conditions (such as rainfall, soil type, and evaporation rates) and different housing types (from single detached houses to high-rise apartment buildings) ensures equity across NSW without placing an excessive cost burden on dwellings in certain regions. The stringency of BASIX energy targets was increased in July 2017: A 10% increase in energy targets for low-rise units and houses.A 5% increase in energy targets to high-rise units.","https://www.iea.org/policies/7380-building-sustainability-index-basix",2017,NA,NA,"IEA"

The necessary legislative amendments were adopted by parliament in June and December 2016. The KÁT system continues to operate for existing plants following the introduction of METÁR; however, only new entrants will be eligible for the METÁR support mechanism.The purpose of the new mechanism is to facilitate the integration of renewable electricity producers into the market, as well as to support the fulfilment of Hungary’s 2020 renewable energy targets. Under METÁR, renewable electricity generators, with the exception of non-wind power plants under 0.5 megawatts (MW) and those already receiving a FIT, shall sell electricity on the market. Different market premiums will apply depending on the capacity of the power plants:In case of smaller power plants of less than 0.5 MW capacity (excluding wind energy) and demonstration projects, the electricity produced shall be purchased by MAVIR, the TSO, and sold by the TSO on the electricity wholesale market (HUPX). The purpose of this measure is to shield small producers from some of the market sales, clearing and price risks. These producers, therefore, remain in the same position as before.In case of power plants of medium capacity (between 0.5 MW and 1 MW), an administrative premium, at a level similar to the KÁT, will be paid to producers without any competitive bidding procedure (no tenders).In case of larger power plants (over 1 MW) and wind farms, premium support shall be granted only via competitive tendering procedures (except for demonstration projects).Although METÁR started on 1 January 2017, the details of the tendering scheme are unclear and are under negotiation with the European Commission (March 2016).Following approval from the EU Commission, METÁR will also introduce a brown premium for depreciated biomass and biogas power producers. The purpose of this measure is to avoid the shutdown of these plants or the switch to fossil fuels in depreciated plants.

The new incentive starts to be granted from June 30th 2016 until 30 days after reaching one of the following dates: December 1st 2016 for all the plants or, for the plants who access directly to incentives (art. 4, paragraph 3), December 1st 2017 or;when the indicative cumulative cost of all types of incentives awarded to RES-E plants (other than photovoltaic ones) reaches an overall value of € 5.8 billion per year.The Decree defines three different ways of access to the incentives, depending on plant capacity and type of project (art. 4):  1. Direct access for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded plants with a capacity not exceeding a given limit (art. 4, paragraph 3) and using specific types of sources or for special projects;2. Enrolment into the Registries for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded and renovated plants 3. Awarding of incentives after participation in a competitive Dutch auctions (electronic auctions held by GSE) for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded plants: the capacity of these plants shall exceed a given threshold (5 MW).To determine the way of access to the incentives for renovated plants, the capacity to be considered corresponds to the increase in capacity obtained as a result of the project. The total maximum new installed capacity that could be awarded to all technologies through both registries and auctions is 1.370 MW of which 800 MW for new onshore wind capacity.Between the communication of the registration and the entry into operation the maximum time gap limit depends of the plant technology. A 6 months delay is allowed before losing the registration, but a 0.5% penalty for each month of delay applies on the applicable tariff. After losing the admission, a new successful application leads in any case to a tariff reduced by 15% on the applicable level.The Decree establishes that the support shall be granted for the net electricity generated by the plant and injected into the grid. Therefore, self-consumed electricity is not eligible for incentives.The net electricity generated and injected into the grid is the lower value between the net electricity generated and the electricity actually injected into the grid by the plant. The Decree provides for two separate support schemes, based on plant capacity, renewable source used and type of plant:A) all-inclusive feed-in tariff (To) for plants with a capacity of up to 500 kW; this capacity is given by the sum of a base feed-in tariff (whose value is defined for each source, type of plant and capacity class in Annex 1 of the Decree) and of premiums, if any (e.g. high-efficiency CHP, emission reductions, etc.).B) incentive (l) for plants with a capacity of above 500 kW and for those with a capacity of up to 500 kW not opting for the all-inclusive feed-in tariff; this incentive is given by the difference between the base feed-in tariff – increased by the premiums, if any, for which the plant is eligible - and the hourly zonal electricity price (in the zone where the electricity generated by the plant is injected into the grid). The electricity generated by plants benefiting from the incentive (l) remains the property of the producer. It is worth recalling that the access to the incentives as per the Ministerial Decree of 6 Jul. 2012 is alternative to net metering (“scambio sul posto”) and to simplified purchase/resale arrangements (“ritiro dedicato”).The value of the base feed-in tariff is the one applicable upon the date of commissioning of the plant. GSE will award the all-inclusive feed-in tariff or the incentive, calculated from the value of the base feed-in tariff, as of the date of entry into commercial operation of the plant. For plants commissioned prior to the closing of the period of submission of applications for participating in the Registries or Auctions and whose ranking position in the relevant Registries does not exceed the applicable cost limit, GSE will grant the base feed-in tariff applicable upon the date of closing of the same period.The Decree also provides for a number of premiums (Pr) on top of the base tariff for plants which meet specific operating requirements.The new support period will be equal to the conventional useful life-time of the specific type of plant indicated in Annex 1 of the Decree.","https://www.iea.org/policies/6112-feed-in-premium-for-renewable-energy-sources-other-than-photovoltaic-ministerial-decree-june-23rd-2016",2016,NA,NA,"IEA"

On the basis of those legislative changes Mexico created a wholesale power market with a system of capacity and power auctions in which renewable energy technologies can take part and are additionally supported by Clean Energy Certificates (CLEs).Legislation adopted in August 2014 allows for a competition of private companies in the electricity generation sector. Private investors will be able to buy, sell and build new generation units. Also, private generators, including renewable energy plants, will be able to sell electricity on the spot market, directly to high-volume consumers and to the governmental designated body responsible for transmission and distribution lines. Mexico’s wholesale market was non-existent before the reform and it began test operations starting from September 2015. Simplified but actual operation of the market started in 2016 with full operation planned for 2018.System of medium and long-term auctions will be main mechanisms to procure energy capacity and power including renewables. Auctions will be held at least once a year. Medium-term auctions will provide contracts for 3-years periods. Electricity will be delivered from 1st of January following the year when capacity was contracted.Long-term auctions will provide power purchase contracts for 15-years period, an improvement from the first draft of the regulation where 10-year period was proposed. Longer remuneration period creates more favourable financial environment for renewable investors since it secures their long-term ficing. Long-term auction are split for capacity auction, energy auction and Clean Energy Certificates (CELs).Capacity auctions are open for all projects offering firm capacity both conventional and clean energy technologies.  Projects sign contract to have a given amount of capacity available at a determined zone and dispatch electricity to the spot market when required. Projects must be located within the system that they are bidding into.Energy auctions are open only for clean energy technologies. “Clean energy technologies” are understood in the Mexican law as: nuclear, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, efficient cogeneration, wind and solar installations. Projects must dispatch power to the ode within their generation zone in the national system. Nodes are set by the National Center for Energy Control (CENACE). The most price competitive offer win the bid. There are two different price calculation methods within the energy auction split according to the energy technology defined as baseload clean energy and intermittent clean energy.Baseload clean energy is defined as nuclear, hydropower, biomass, geothermal and efficient cogeneration. Price finding mechanism is straightforward for this type of technologies using simple method of price bidding per MWh.Intermittent clean energy captures wind and solar installations. For this technologies Mexico created an interesting price calculation method that rewards projects for producing electricity when their generation is needed the most and obliges generators to pay to the system for producing when the electricity supply exceeds the demand. The system is based on the set of price reference benchmarks. The benchmarks are set taking into account daily, seasonal, yearly and location specific differences in an electricity market value. The benchmarks are set ahead for 15 years and do not change once contracted. The benchmarks can be adjusted down or up in the future energy auctions. The benchmarks are calculated on the basis of expected and the average marginal price in the generation zone. CENACE is an institution responsible for calculation and announcement of the price benchmarks.Wind and solar projects place one bid per contract (price in the USD or Mexican Pesos per MWh of electricity produced for the duration of plant’s lifetime). Winning bids sign 15-years contracts and start generating. When the established benchmark exceeds the expected average marginal price of the electricity, the intermittent producer receives value of the bid (written in the contract) plus the benchmark value. In a case when the benchmarks is lower than the expected average marginal price of the electricity the intermittent producer received value of the bid minus the benchmark. Therefore the revenues of the generator differ per hour, day, month and a year. Given this system of price calculation, it is very important for the bidders to carefully choose the node that they bid into since the benchmark is calculated per each node.The Clean Energy Certificates (CELs) are awarded only to the clean energy generators. The government determines the requirements for CELson a yearly basis three years in advance of the compliance period. The first compliance period will be in 2018 with quota set at 5% level. All clean energy generators, defined as power plants using clean energies, developed after August 2014 will receive 1 CEL/MWh generated. Certificates will be issues to the generators for period of 20 years. Clean energy certificates are bankable and do not expire. Penalty for non-compliance is between USD 30-250/MWh. The certificates can be purchased and sold, under monitoring of the regulatory commission of energy. Up to 6 million of the certificates will be awarded in the first auction via 20-year contracts that seek to produce up to 2,500 MW of additional power generation from clean energy sources.The first long-term auction were be held in 2016: In November 2015 Mexico announced the call for proposals for Mexico’s first large-scale power auction. In January, CENACE published capacity and energy demand to be met via the auctions. Capacity auction was opened for 500 MW of installations. Energy auction was opened for total of 6.46 TWh/year auctioned with a ceiling price of USD 49/MWh. 103 bidders expressed interest by applying for pre-qualification which testifies to the strong interest of the industry. Certificate auction was opened for 6 million of CLEs with a ceiling price of USD 26/CLE.

"4596","Poland","POL",NA,NA,"Renewable Energy Act of Poland (Amended)","In February 2015 Poland adopted its long-debated Renewable Energy Act. The new law was amended two times and entered into force in July 2016.  The Law replaces the green certificate system with auction scheme.  The first auction took place on 30th of December 2016 with results being announced early January 2017. Further auctions took place in spring 2017 and were scheduled as well for summer and autumn 2017. However, the latter two 2017 auction rounds were canceled as the Act was not clear on combining auction contract with other forms of public support breaching EU’s rules on fair competition. These inaccuracies triggered work on the subsequent amendment to the Act that entered into force on 29th of June 2018.  The June 2018 amendment modified the auction system and in effect unblocked it. The Energy Regulatory Office (URE) of Poland is obliged to organise and run auction rounds by the end of 2018 and in 2019 in order to bring new renewable power capacity into the system.    The June 2018 amendment modified auction technology baskets. The new baskets are as follow:  Basket   (PL: “Koszyk”)   Technologies eligible       Basket 1          1) installations using only biogas obtained from landfills;  2) installations using only biogas obtained from sewage treatment plants;  3) installations using only biogas other than those specified in items 1 and 2 above;  4) exclusively dedicated biomass combustion installations or hybrid systems;  5) only installations using biomass, biogas, biogas or agricultural biogas incinerated in a dedicated multi-fuel combustion plant;  6) exclusively dedicated to biomass combustion installations or hybrid systems, in high-efficiency cogeneration.       Basket 2      1) installations using only hydropower for electricity generation and  2) installations using only geothermal energy for generating electricity, as well  3) installations using only offshore wind energy.       Basket 3  Agriculture biogas installations  Basket 4      1) onshore wind  2) solar PV installations       Basket 5  Hybrid installations  Projects selected through auction processes will receive 15 year long Power Purchase Agreements. The design and introduction of the auction support system was a revolutionary change in the area of support for electricity generation from renewable sources. This system ensures the competitiveness of entities entering the auctions, which translates into maximum favourable electricity prices, and consequently has an impact on the cost of electricity offered to end users. The auction is won by entrepreneurs who offered the lowest energy sales price.The principles of the auction mechanism, together with subsequent updates of the RES Act, were subject to changes, which concerned, among others, the system of division into so-called ""auction baskets"".Over the period of several years the auction settlement method has also evolved. The auctions held in 2016 and 2017 were won by participants who offered the lowest selling price - until the quantity or value of this energy specified in the auction announcement is exhausted. The amendment to the Act of 2018 introduced the so-called rule of enforcing competition. According to this rule, the auction is won by the participants who offered the lowest energy sale price and whose bids did not exceed 100 per cent of the value or amount of energy specified in the auction announcement and 80 per cent of the amount of electricity covered by all submitted bids. Such a provision allows to avoid a situation in which all bids win the auction, even if the amount or value of electricity in the submitted bids does not exhaust the entire volume or value indicated in the announcement.","https://www.iea.org/policies/5737-renewable-energy-act-of-poland-amended",2016,NA,NA,"IEA"

Under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, the US EPA established interim and final CO2 emissions performance rates for two subcategories of fossil fuel-fired electric generation units:    Fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units (generally, coal- and oil-fired power plants);  Natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units  To maximize the range of choices available to states in implementing the standards and to utilities in meeting them, the EPA established interim and final statewide goals in three forms:  A rate-based state goal measured in pounds per megawatt hour (lb/MWh);  A mass-based state goal measured in total short tons of CO2;  A mass-based state goal with a new source complement measured in total short tons of CO2.  States then develop and implement plans that ensure that the power plants in their state - either individually, together or in combination with other measures - achieve the interim CO2 emissions performance rates over the period of 2022 to 2029 and the final CO2 emission performance rates, rate-based goals or mass-based goals by 2030.  Through the best system of emissions reduction available, the rule determined three ""Building Blocks"" for states to achieve the interim and final emissions reductions targets.  These blocks are:  Building Block 1: reducing the carbon intensity of electricity generation by improving the heat rate of existing coal-fired power plants;  Building Block 2: substituting increased electricity generation from lower-emitting existing natural gas plants for reduced generation from higher-emitting coal fired power plants;  Building Block 3: substituting increased electricity generation from new zero-emitting renewable energy sources (like wind and solar) for reduced generation from existing coal-fired power plants.   Once the state has developed a plan to reduce emissions and the EPA issues approval, the state has 15 years for full implementation. Within the time frame, there will be three interim goals that the states must meet to ensure compliance with the final emissions reduction goal.  On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review. On October 10, 2018, EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan,  after completing a thorough review as directed by the Energy Independence Executive Order.","https://www.iea.org/policies/829-clean-power-plan",2015,NA,NA,"IEA"

The NEP calls for the electrification rate milestones of 50% in 2020, 75% in 2025 and 100% in 2030.While long-term electricity access will chiefly be provided through the main grid, the short and mid-term will require substantial mini-grid and off-grid investments to ensure basic electricity services reaching large number of users in relatively little time. The NEP therefore takes a two-fold approach: (1) A grid extension programme and (2) an off-grid programme. The off-grid programme is composed of solar home systems and mini-grids with the target population being those who would have to wait especially long for the main grid to reach their homes and/or the regions where grid expansion entails prohibitive costs.","https://www.iea.org/policies/6287-myanmar-national-electrification-project-nep",2015,NA,NA,"IEA"

Regarding renewable energies, it supersedes the existing special regime for electricity producers, maintaining the fundamental principle of previous supporting schemes: a reasonable return.The provisions contained in Royal Decree-Law 9/2013, of July 12, 2013 have basically been included for the calculation of the for electricity generation using renewable energy sources, high-efficiency cogeneration and waste to energy plants.Remuneration of renewable energies, high-efficiency CHP and waste to energy facilities, will be based on the necessary participation in the market by these facilities, and will supplement the market revenues with a specific regulated subsidy that will enable these technologies to compete on an equal footing with other technologies in the market. This specific subsidy will be sufficient to attain the minimum level required to cover the investment and operating costs that these technologies cannot recover in the market and may enable them to obtain a suitable return.In the systems of the no-mainland territories, it can be added an incentive for investment and completion within a given period where the facility entails a significant cost reduction. The subsidy parameter review criteria will be set taking into account the cyclical situation of the economy, electricity demand and appropriate profitability of these activities. It also establishes that the allocation of these subsidies to new facilities should be established through competitive tendering procedures It rules hydroelectric authorizations as well. Even though the producers of electricity using renewable sources, and high efficiency cogeneration will continue to have preference for access and connection to the grid, the electricity coming from these facilities will only have preference for being dispatched under equal economic conditions in the market.","https://www.iea.org/policies/5655-electricity-sector-regulation-electricity-law-242013",2013,NA,NA,"IEA"

"4786","United Kingdom","GBR",NA,NA,"Energy Company Obligation","The Energy Companies Obligation (ECO) was introduced in January 2013 to reduce the UK's energy consumption and support people living in fuel poverty. It will run until 2017, supporting the installation of energy efficiency measures in low-income households and areas, and in properties that are harder to treat. The ECO replaces two previous schemes, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) and the Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP). ECO places legal obligations on the larger energy suppliers to deliver energy efficiency measures to domestic energy users. It operates alongside the Green Deal (see separate entry), which is designed to help people make energy efficiency improvements to buildings by allowing them to pay the costs through their energy bills rather than upfront. The Green Deal and the ECO will help reduce carbon emissions from the UK's domestic building stock, which is an essential part of the UK's plan to meet its statutory domestic carbon emission reduction targets by 2050.The ECO is intended to work alongside the Green Deal to provide additional support in the domestic sector, with a particular focus on vulnerable consumer groups and hard-to-treat homes. Under the rules of ECO, energy suppliers are obliged to help improve the energy efficiency of their domestic customers' buildings in three distinct areas:1. Carbon Emissions Reduction ObligationUnder the Carbon Emissions Reduction Obligation, energy companies must concentrate efforts on hard-to-treat homes and measures that cannot be fully funded through the Green Deal. Solid wall insulation and hard-to-treat cavity wall insulation are the primary areas for focus under this target. Other insulation measures and connections to district heating systems are also eligible if they are promoted as part of a package that includes solid wall insulation or hard-to-treat cavity wall insulation.2. Community ObligationUnder the Carbon Saving Community Obligation, energy companies must focus on the provision of insulation measures and connections to domestic district heating systems supplying areas of low income. This target has a sub-target, which states that at least 15% of each supplier's Carbon Saving Community Obligation must be achieved by promoting measures to low income and vulnerable households living in rural areas.3. Home Heating Cost Reduction ObligationUnder the Home Heating Cost Reduction Obligation, energy suppliers are required to provide measures that improve the ability of low income and vulnerable households (the ""Affordable Warmth Group"") to heat their homes. This includes actions that result in heating savings, such as the replacement or repair of a boiler for example.","https://www.iea.org/policies/1301-energy-company-obligation",2013,NA,NA,"IEA"

Prior to signing a Green Deal Plan, an assessor will recommend improvements that are appropriate for a property and indicate whether they can be expected to pay for themselves through reduced energy bills.  Green Deal Providers (the companies offering loans) will discuss with the consumer whether a Green Deal Plan is right for him/her and provide a quote for the recommended improvements. Consumers can get as many quotes as they like, and they do not have to choose all of the recommendations made to them. Once they have chosen a Green Deal Provider, the Provider will write up a Green Deal Plan.   The plan is a contract between the consumer and the Provider, it sets out the work that will be done and the repayments. Installation must be carried out by an authorised installer. The Green Deal Provider will help calculate the repayments, including interest, which the consumer will need to make. While the repayments should be no more than what a typical bill-payer should save, the actual savings will depend on how much energy the consumer uses and the future costs of energy. If the consumer moves, the new bill-payer will benefit from the improvements, and so will take on the repayments.    A requirement on larger energy suppliers ""the Energy Company Obligation (ECO)"" will work alongside the Green Deal to provide additional support for viable packages of energy efficiency measures that are unlikely to be fully financed by the Green Deal. These packages could include insulation of hard-to-treat cavities or solid walls.

Instead of limiting the payment of the system service bonus, fixed at EUR cent 0.48/kWh for the year 2012, to the end of 2013, it will be paid until end of 2014 for new and until end of 2015 for existing facilities. The repowering bonus of EUR Cent 0.5/kWh (to support the replacement of old turbines by new ones) is restricted to wind turbines that were put into operation before the year 2002.For offshore wind, the initial tariff remains at EUR Cent 15/kWh. The tariff for new turbines will not be decreased before the year 2018 (instead of 2015 initially), with a then 7% annual rate of degression ( 5% intially). To accelerate repayment of investment in offshore wind farms an optional feed-in tariff model was introduced, which offers an initial tariff of EUR Cent 19 /kWh paid for 8 years (standard model: EUR cent 15/kWh for 12 years).A number of further supporting measures outside the EEG are taken to stimulate offshore wind energy, among others a dedicated loan programme of the KfW bank.For hydropower the tariff structure is simplified and harmonised: the differentiation between new and modernised facilities is abandoned, the feed-in tariff will be paid for 20 years and the initial remuneration will decrease by one percent per year. Initial tariffs are: - up to 500 kilowat: EUR Cent 12.7/kWhEUR - up to 2 megawatt (MW): EUR Cent 8.3/kWh - up to 5 MW: EUR Cent 6.3 ct/kWh - up to 10 MW:EUR Cent 5.5 ct/kWh - up to 20 MW: EUR Cent 5.3 ct/kWh - up to 50 MW: EUR Cent 4.2 ct/kWh - over 50 MW: EUR Cent 3.4 ct/kWh .For biomass facilities tariffs decrease by 10 to 15 per cent on average, compared to the EEG 2009. Biogas plants only qualify for remuneration if they comply with basic requirements: at least 60 per cent of the heat produced is used, or the facility is operated using 60 per cent or more of slurry, or the electricity is sold directly.Furthermore electricity from biogas may not be based on more than 60 per cent of maize and grain. The tariff structure is simplified and harmonised, having 4 capacity-oriented categories (basic tariff from EUR Cent 6 to 14.3/kWh). Additional remuneration is paid depending on the type of biomass used as fuel (from EUR Cent 2.5 to 8/kWh). Small facilities on farms that deploy at least 80 per cent slurry receive a remuneration of 25 ct/kWh. Furthermore there is a special tariff for waste biomass fermentation plants. A bonus of EUR Cent 1 to 3/kWh is paid for processing and feed-in of bio-methane. The initial basic tariff decreases by two percent per year, whereas the fuel-related tariff does not change.Tariffs for geothermal facilities increase from EUR Cent 23 to 25/kWh; initial tariffs decrease by 5 percent annually from 2018.The bonus for use of petrothermal technology increases from EUR Cent 4 to 5/kWh.The tariff structure of the EEG 2009 for photovoltaic plants is continued. The tariff may be decreased twice a year depending on the capacity newly built in the previous period: on 1 January tariffs decrease between 1.5 per cent and 24 per cent (basic degression rate of 9 per cent for an additional capacity installed between 2,500 and 3,500 MW). A part of the decrease (0 to 15 per cent) can be antedated on 1 July, if capacity expansion exceeds defined threshold values. The special tariff for electricity consumed within the building or site of production remains in force until end of the year 2013. New free-standing facilities on conversion areas in natural reserves and national parks are not eligible for remuneration.To improve grid integration of PV facilities over 100 kW underlie feed-in management, for facilities over 30 kW a simplified feed-in management will apply. Smaller facilities may also participate in the latter, or alternatively may feed in a maximum of 70 per cent of their installed power.To limit the increase of total feed-in-payments an amendment referring to PV facilites ('PV-Novelle') was agreed on end of June 2012, but effective 1 April 2012. Main components of this amendment are an overall target of 52 Gigawatt of PV power reimbursed according to the feed-in tariff (FIT), an extra decrease of tariffs, a modification of the degression scheme reducing tariffs by 1% monthly (corresponding to a basic degression rate of ca. 11.4% p.a.), the introduction of a new category for roof-top facilities and the limitation of the total power of a facility to 10 Megawatt.With effect from 1 January 2013 the management premium (which is part of the market premium) for wind and PV facilities is reduced.","https://www.iea.org/policies/5117-2012-amendment-of-the-renewable-energy-sources-act-eeg-2012",2012,NA,NA,"IEA"

According to the Agreement in 2020 half of the electricity consumption will come from wind power, enabling a share of 35% renewable energy in gross energy consumption in 2020. Moreover, the energy consumption is to decrease by more than 12 % in 2020 compared to 2006. The initiatives in the Agreement will lead to CO2 emissions in 2020 being  34% lower than they were in 1990. At the same time, the Agreement is to ensure a stable framework for the business community as a whole, and the energy sector in particular.   Renewable energy in power generation The Agreement secures substantial expansion of wind power, corresponding to the annual consumption of 1 ½ million households. Thus in 2020, wind power will account for approximately 50% of Danish electricity consumption. The Agreement implies that: 600 MW offshore wind turbines will be built at Kriegers Flak and 400 MW offshore wind turbines will be built at Horns Rev before 2020; a further 500 MW offshore wind turbines will be installed near the coast before 2020; new planning tools will encourage development of onshore wind turbines with a total capacity of 1,800 MW up until 2020; over a period of four years, a total of DKK 100 million will be committed to funding development and use of new renewable energy technologies for electricity production (solar, waves ,etc.) as well as DKK 25 million for wave power demonstration facilities. Energy-efficiency  measures With the Agreement initiatives, in 2020 Denmark will have reduced its final energy consumption (excluding consumption for transport) by almost 8% compared to 2010. The Agreement contains the following elements: energy companies must realise specific energy savings exceeding today requirements, e.g. by consulting energy experts and by offering subsidies to e.g. households and businesses; energy companies must increase efforts by 75% from 2013 to 2014, and by 100% from 2015 to 2020 compared to 2010-12; a comprehensive strategy for energy renovation of all Danish buildings will be developed. Green heating measures: converting from coal to biomass at large-scale power plants will be made more attractive by amending the Heating Supply Act; the smaller open-field plants that are struggling in the wake of high heating prices will be allowed to produce cheap heating based on biomass; DKK 35 million will be committed to promoting new renewable technologies, e.g. geothermal energy and large heat pumps. Renewable energy in buildings   The Agreement supports the phasing-out of oil-fired boilers in existing buildings by: banning installation of oil-fired boilers and natural gas boilers in new buildings from 2013; banning installation of new oil-fired boilers in existing buildings in areas where district heating or natural gas is available from 2016; committing DKK 42 million in 2012-15 to fund the conversion from oil-fired boilers and natural gas boilers in existing buildings to renewable energy. Renewable energy in industry Industry must also convert to a greener energy system. Therefore the Agreement lays down that: -                a subsidy should be given to help promote investment in energy efficient use of renewable energy in the production processes of enterprises. In the period 2014 to 2020, the subsidy will be increased to DKK 500 million a year from DKK 250 million in 2013: -                  funding of DKK 30 million per year from 2013 to 2020 will be introduced to maintain and promote industrial CHP in industries and greenhouses. Deployment of Smart Grids Large electricity consumption in combination with wind power requires an intelligent energy system. Therefore the Agreement lays down that: a comprehensive strategy for establishing smart grids in Denmark is to be drawn up; An expansion of biogas is also to be implemented. In order to create momentum in this must improve the economic conditions for biogas production and biogas must to a greater extent than today could be used outside the cogeneration sector. The parties are, therefore, agree that it total support for biogas used for cogeneration or sent out into the natural gas network should be able toreceive support of DKK 115 / GJ in 2012;  In the long term, the transport sector must undergo a radical transformation from fossil fuels to new ones propellants such as electricity and biomass; Investments in research, development and demonstration are prerequisites for Danish companies in so that they can develop and sell green solutions and create green jobs in the long term.","https://www.iea.org/policies/606-danish-energy-agreement-for-2012-2020",2012,NA,NA,"IEA"

After losing the admission, a new successful application leads in any case to a tariff reduced by 15% on the applicable level. The following plants can access the tariffs directly upon entry into operation:(i) wind and oceanic streams with capacity not exceeding 60 kW,(ii) hydro streams with capacity not exceeding 50 kW,(iii) hydro streams with capacity not exceeding 250 kW, where built on existing channels and pipes without increase of the flux, that use returned waters or waste water, that use the minimal flow of dams excluding the climb-up volumes,(iv) biomasses streams with capacity not exceeding 200 kW,(v) biogas streams with capacity not exceeding 100 kW,(vi) repowered plants that fall within the above categories,(vii) re-built plants that fall within the above categories,(viii) plants subject to public tenders called by public entities that plants that fall within the above categories,(ix) plants for the conversion of the sugar industry, and(x) geothermal with medium and high enthalpy with re-injection up to 5 MW.Existing plants getting green certificates will be paid with the new tariffs: they will receive a tariff of 78% of the target regulated price of green certificates.For plants with capacity up to 1 MW the incentive is a feed-in tariff (it is paid on the electricity sold to GSE), but the owner of the plant can request the regime of the bigger plants. For plants with capacity exceeding 1 MW the incentive is in the form of a feed-in premium (it is paid on the electricity generated which is not to GSE).

FIT rates were set by the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board (UARB). Nova Scotia Power Inc. recovers costs incurred from the programme through rate-based adjustments. Following a review, on 6 August 2015, Nova Scotia decided to close the COMFIT programme for new applications. The COMFIT is considered a success but small-scale community renewables projects started putting upward pressure on prices, hence more cost-effective alternatives were considered under the DFIT scheme.In 2013, the UARB presented DFIT rates for large-scale projects in three categories: Test phase I which targets single devices for three years, located at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy; Test phase II which targets single or multiple devices for up to 15 years; and developmental phase III which targets single or multiple devices, with each turbine nameplate capacity greater than 500 kW, for up to 15 years. The province of Nova Scotia plans to approve 15 to 20 MW of tidal energy at the rates set by the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board.

A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector.Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector.In the building sector, the Danish government is going a step forward in implementing very ambitious building code, banning oil boilers in all new constructions and, by 2017, in all houses while biomass, biogas and solar thermal appliances will be strongly encouraged.Denmark also targets the large scale deployment of offshore wind as well as dramatic growth in the wind manufacturing sector, and will fund research and development in for solar and wave power, support main demonstration projects for large heat pumps intended to be used in district heating plants and fund other geothermal energy research projects.In order to generate revenues to finance the energy shift of the country, Denmark will introduce a public service obligation tax on electricity and gas, while tax on oil, gas and coal will be further increased to discourage their use.With regards to nuclear, the country has maintained its ban on nuclear power programme and, since there is no potential for large hydropower project , most of the funding will be dedicated to new renewable sources.","https://www.iea.org/policies/5122-energy-strategy-2050",2011,NA,NA,"IEA"

The UK power system needs to tackle 5 main challenges, namely:- Supply security, as old and polluting generation plants are bound to close (20GW by 2020) and as the system needs to adapt to higher levels of intermittent (wind) and inflexible generation (nuclear).- The need for electricity mix decarbonisation to reach 2020 RE targets -15% of primary energy needs from RE.- The increase in generation capacity to meet rising demand (transport sector electrification needs) in parallel with energy savings and efficiency practices.- Great need for cost-efficient investments to avoid high increases in cost of electricity, considering that carbon price and environmental policies are likely to lead to higher bills in the future.The government has identified several key tools, central to the reform strategy, that would allow for the transition to a decarbonised energy system to happen, namely:- The Feed in tariffs with Contract for Difference, expected to start by 2014, will provide a clear, stable and predictable revenue stream for investors. None of the tariff adjustments are retroactive.- The Carbon Price Floor, expected to be in force by 2013, would guarantee a fair price on carbon and provide a stronger incentive to encourage investment in low carbon generation.- The Emission Performance Standard (EPS) expected to be in force by 2013, equivalent to 450g CO2/kWh at baseload, to limit the amount of carbon new fossil-fuel power plants can emit.Engaging with energy consumers to reduce demand will also become a priority both in the electricity and the heating sectors, where the Green deal will help to reduce cost and carbon emissions in buildings, with smart electricity and gas meters. On the short term, the market design reform shall allow for a smooth transition and investments to continue. Therefore, the existing Renewables Obligation will continue for existing projects supported by the scheme (principle of no retrospective change) and new ones until March 31st 2017. Between 2011 and 2017 new renewable energy generators will have a one-off choice between Renewable obligation support of feed-in tariff.

The scheme was amended several times since its adoption, and more recently by Act No. 441/2018. The changes includes a legal framework for opening up the market for production of renewable electricity with a new tender- based premium scheme. The Energy Agency opened up the first tendering round in autumn 2018 from 15 of November to 31 of December. The tenders up for offer will be 1.4 TWh annually.  The scheme is technology neutral for new producers of electricity from wind, solar, biogas, biomass wood fuels and wave power. The premium offered is capped at € 53.5 MWh (§ 32 Act No. 1396/2010),The market price is determined in yearly quarters. Nota. Since 2013 the support paid for use of forest chips in electricity production has been dependent on price for EU emissions allowance and tax rate on peat, as it earlier was dependent only on price for EU emissions allowance. The support for use of forest chips has also been modified so that the aid level for electricity produced with forest chips will be reduced by 40 %, if the forest chips are produced from industrial roundwood (i.e. logs or pulpwood, BDH >16 cm) originating from a felling site of large-sized trees. The production support scheme consists of two different premiums: A sliding premium tariff for new investments in wind power, power from biogas (landfill gas excluded) and power from small CHP power plants using wood fuel (hereinafter “the wood fuel plant”). The tariff is dependent on the market price of electricity, i.e. the difference between the target price in the legislation and the spot price of electricity. Heat premium is paid on top of the basic tariff for biogas and wood fuel plants that produce also heat with certain efficiency.  A sliding premium tariff for electricity produced from wood chips. This tariff is dependent on the EU emissions allowance price and tax rate on peat. The tariff compensates on the difference of running costs of using peat and wood chips in power and heat production. As the tariff doesn’t compensate capital costs of the power plant the tariff is paid also to existing power plants. Also this support scheme contains elements that encourage the efficient production of electricity and heat in CHP units.Support for wind power was closed the end of 2017.","https://www.iea.org/policies/6539-finland-tender-based-feed-in-premium-scheme-for-renewable-power-generation-301220101396",2011,NA,NA,"IEA"

"4953","India","IND",NA,NA,"Perform, Achieve, Trade (PAT) Scheme","The Perform, Achieve, Trade (PAT) scheme was establihed by National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency. It is regulatory instrument to reduce specific energy consumption in energy intensive industries, with an associated market based mechanism to enhance the cost effectiveness through certification of excess energy saving which can be traded.  The first cycle of the PAT Scheme (2012-2015) managed to reduce the energy consumption of more than 400 energy-intensive enterprises (known as Designated Consumers  -DCs) by 5.3%, above the initial target of 4.1%. The targets were originally established based on annual specific energy consumption for each DC in 2010 (baseline year) and adjusted to account for factors such as product mix, capacity utilisation, change in fuel quality, import/export of power and other factors.Following the evaluation of the first cycle, all sectors surpassed their targets except for the thermal power generation sector, which had the highest target of the 8 subsectors covered under the PAT programme. The reason for this was mainly due to the unavailability of new efficient natural gas power plants and partly due to lower than expected electricity demand from the thermal generation sector, which subsequently led to a reduction in power plant performance.Overall, majority of the DCs implemented relatively low cost measures, such as changes to process control and installation of variable speed drives on electric motors, which were financed through the DCs own resources. In terms of sector specific interventions, for example, in the cement industry the most common measures covered installation of waste heat recovery systems and vertical rolling mills. In the iron and steel sector, measures included installation of top recovery turbines and adoption of coke dry quenching process.The trading of energy saving certificates (ESCerts) is central to the PAT programme and serves as an incentive to reach or surpass the mandatory targets. The ESCerts, equivalent to 1 tonne of oil equivalent (toe) of energy savings, are given based on quantified energy savings verified by an accredited energy auditor. The ESCerts are awarded after a DC surpasses its target and can then be sold to another DC that has failed to achieve its target, the price for which is determined through market supply and demand. The ESCerts can also be banked for next PAT cycles of the respective DC to contribute towards meeting future targets as the PAT programme expands.The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission acts as the market regulator by defining the regulatory framework for trading of the ESCerts, while the Power System Operation Corporation is responsible for the centralized ESCert registry. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency is the administrator and developed a platform to manage the ESCert trading process. Starting from April 2017, the Indian Energy Exchange and the Power Exchange of India will manage ESCert trading (until now no ESCerts had been traded). The demand for ESCerts is expected to be relatively low, given that about 3.8 million ESCerts have been issued of which about 1.5 million need to be absorbed by the DCs who are falling short of targets.If a DC has not met its target and fails to purchase sufficient ESCerts to compensate for its shortfall, it will be subject to a penalty. The penalty for non-compliance is 1 million INR (about 15 000 USD) plus the value of the energy savings that have not been obtained by the DC, measured in toe. The price of 1 toe is determined by a combination of coal, fuel, gas and electricity prices as declared by the Indian government. For example, the cost of coal is based on the price of F-grade coal declared by the Ministry of Coal multiplied by the amount of coal consumed by the 478 DCs and the total energy consumed in the 478 DCs. In 2011-2012, the market value of 1 toe was approximately 10 154 INR (approximately 151 USD) and in 2014-2015 it was 10 968 INR (approximately 160","https://www.iea.org/policies/1780-perform-achieve-trade-pat-scheme",2011,NA,NA,"IEA"

"4966","India","IND",NA,NA,"Renewable Energy Certificates system","As of 2011, the Indian government launched the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) system to rapidly increase the share of renewable energy in total energy mix. RECs will become essential for states and utilities in meeting their respective Renewable Portfolio Obligation targets. In fact, Indian states have to cope with fixed RPO targets, also set at the federal level. They decline as follows for the years 2010 to 2015: In 2010, 5% of total energy generated from renewable sources, 6% in 2011, 7% in 2012, 8% in 2013, 9% in 2014 and 10% in 2015. In 2010, some states such as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu exceeded their renewable obligation while others, as Punjab and Haryana, have encountered difficulties in meeting their quota. The latest could therefore purchase renewable certificates from states that have met their RPO compliance and have adequate RE potential. As of March 2011, the National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC) responsible for certifying RE projects had issued 100 RECs to 6 renewable energy projects representing 51.6 MW of total generation capacity, and 23 projects are waiting for NLDC s approval. Eligible projects must represent a minimum installed capacity of 250 kW, commissioned no earlier than April 2010, and are not eligible for a feed-in tariff.

"5019","Italy","ITA",NA,NA,"Measures for increasing competition in the natural gas market and transferring the ensuing benefits to final customers","Implementing the provisions of Law 99/2009 of 13 August 2010, the Italian Council of Ministers approved a Legislative Decree for introducing thresholds of wholesale market shares for operators feeding natural gas into the Italian transport network. This substitutes the existing antitrust ceilings introduced by Legislative Decree no. 164/2000 (which expired at the end of 2010), also identifying new measures for increasing competition in the natural gas market. The Decree provides that antitrust ceilings be calculated with reference to the market share of each operator, taking into account the amount of natural gas input into the national network, purchases in spot markets, and sales to importers in Italy made at national network entry points. Consequently, market shares will not be lower than the amount input to the network. Operators in the natural gas market will have to comply with a maximum share of 40% of domestic consumption. A mechanism of gas release at regulated prices is provided in case an operator fails to comply with the mandatory ceilings on the market share. This ceiling can be raised to 55% in case an operator commits itself to building new storage capacity in Italy for a total of 4 bcm within five years. The decree introduces measures for increasing competition in the natural gas market aiming at transferring the ensuing benefits to final customers, increasing storage capacity, supporting the security of supplies and enhancing flexibility in the gas system. To achieve this target, compensation to municipalities interested by the construction of new storage fields has been provided. Furthermore, in 2011 AEEG is expected to publish a new regulation concerning economic compensation mechanisms in the natural gas market.","https://www.iea.org/policies/144-measures-for-increasing-competition-in-the-natural-gas-market-and-transferring-the-ensuing-benefits-to-final-customers",2010,NA,NA,"IEA"
"5020","Portugal","PRT",NA,NA,"Microgeneration Law  (Application Decree Law 118-A/2010)","The Microgeneration Law regulates the microproduction of electricity from renewable energy sources. It provides for a simplified licensing regime for local grid connected, low-voltage, small/residential renewable energy producers. Any entity that has a contract for purchasing electricity can be a producer of electricity from renewable energy sources, covering solar, wind, hydro, cogeneration, biomass, and fuel cells using hydrogen from renewable energy microproduction. Licensing is conducted through the internet, via the System of Registration of Microproducers (SRM), an electronic platform through with producers register their installations. Micro producers cannot inject more than 50 % of the power mentioned in the purchasing contract, limited to 3.68 kW, except in the case of installations for condominiums. There are two types of feed-in tariffs: General Regime - The tariff is equal to the cost of electricity sold under the purchasing contract Bonified Tariff - a special reference tariff is defined during the first 5 years following the installation. The reference tariff for the first 10 MW installed is defined as EUR 650/MWh and decreases 5 % for each additional 10 MW registered in the SRM. The reference tariff applies differently depending on the renewable energy technology used. It is 100% for solar (i.e., the full EUR 650/MWh), 70% for wind, 30% for hydro, cogeneration and biomass. For fuel cells, the tariff is the one that applies to the renewable energy source used for hydrogen production. As of October 2010, the Decree Law 118-A/2010 modifies some aspects of Microgeneration Law DL 363/2007 . This amendment intends to support the generation of electricity from renewable sources in Low voltage systems by simplifying the application procedure. The new regulation increases the annual ceiling for installation to 25 MW per year and streamlines the access to the Micro Production regime for public, social, education, defense and local institutions. Moreover, the Bonified Regime is adjusted to the cost of equipments used in the Micro production and can only be accesssed under certain conditions, namely the compliance with energy efficiency measures and the use of solar thermal collectors or biomass boilers. An incentive is also provided for State Laboratories in order to increase R&D in this field.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4732-microgeneration-law-application-decree-law-118-a2010",2010,NA,NA,"IEA"

This tariff will be decreased every year for new installations by 1%, as opposed to the previous 2%.The law also increases the repowering bonus, to support the replacement of old turbines by new ones. The initial remuneration will be increased by EUR 0.5 cent/kWh. Turbines that are replaced must be located in the same administrative district and be at least ten years old. The new turbine needs to have at least twice, but no more than five times the original turbines capacity.For offshore wind, the initial tariff is set at EUR cent 15 /kWh until 2015. After that it is set to decrease to EUR cent 13/kWh for new turbines, decreasing by 5% per year.The amendment is meant to reflect the increasing costs faced by wind turbine manufacturers, largely due to increases in the costs of raw materials such as steel and copper.Hydropower tariffs have increased, and differentiate between new and modernised facilities.For capacity up to 500kW, the tariff is EUR cents 12.67/kWh for new and EUR cents 11.67/kWh for modernised facilities.Between 500kW and 2MW the tariff for both facilities is EUR cents 8.65/kwh, andBetween 2 and 5MW it is EUR cents 7.65/kWh for new and EUR cents 8.65/kWh for modernised facilities.For facilities over 5MW, the tariff starts at EUR cents 7.29/kWh for the first 500kW of output, decreasing for increasing outputs in three steps to reach EUR cents 3.05/kWh for output over 50MW. These same tariffs apply for capacity added to existing facilities that have more than 5MW capacity.Biogas facility tariff changes generally favour small plants.Tariffs for landfill gas facilities have increased for small plants up to 500kWel, to EUR cents 9/kWh from the previous 7.11. Tariffs for mine gas facilities up to 1MWel have also increased to EUR cents 7.16/kWh, and have decreased to EUR cents 5.16 and 4.16/kWh for capacity above 1MW and above 5MW respectively.A new technology bonus is available for reprocessing facilities for landfill and sewage gas and biomass, of EUR cents 2/kWh up to a maximum of 350m3/hour and EUR cents 1/kWh up to a maximum of 700 m3/hour.Small biomass facilities also benefit, with tariffs increased to EUR cents 11.67/kWh for capacity up to 150kWel (from EUR cents 10.67/kWel). Under the new EEG, the tariff of EUR cents 7.79/kWh for capacity over 5MW only applies if the electricity is produced using combined heat and power generation.In addition, the CHP bonus for electricity produced using biomass combined heat and power increased to EUR cents 3/kWh. The tariff and bonuses will decrease by 1% a year. In addition, biogas and biomass production that uses energy crops, waste biomass and manure are eligible for bonuses.Tariffs for geothermal facilities increase and are simplified into under and over 10MW capacity categories. For the former the rate is EUR cents 16/kWh, and for the latter EUR cents 10.5/kWh.New heat cogeneration bonuses were introduced, of EUR cents 3/kWh for a capacity of up to 10MWel, increasing to EUR cents 4/kWh if petrothermal technology is used.

Accordingly, in this context, the Cabinet of Ministers Ruling in hand set up an organised power plant commissioning calendar for the years to come; focusing on Wind and Solar Thermal Electric renewable energy technologies, and up to the end of 2012 and 2013 respectively. It establishes a power plant commissioning roadmap which allocates an annual average installed capacity slightly higher than 1,700 MW for wind power and 500 MW for solar thermal electric power. The Ruling intends to administer the amount of renewable energy installed so as to offer a sensible apportionment of consumer costs over the years, as well as to provide technical feasibility of renewable energy integration into the electrical grid. At the same time, it minimises uncertainty for the industry and investors, by providing a medium-term foreseeable future, which will assist all involved agents in their business and risk planning.

As such, domestic and foreign primary energy sources will be used optimally in accordance with the National Energy Policy to ensure a sustainable supply of electricity. Furthermore,government policy for the power sector specifies that the use of domestic energy sources will be prioritised in the national interest.Electricity Law No. 15 of 1985 allowed for the initial, but limited participation of IPPs in the electricity generation market.This law was replaced by Electricity Law No. 20 of 2002, which allowed for greater private participation in the electricity sector. In addition, Electricity Law No. 20 introduced an independent market regulator through the establishment of the Electricity Market Supervisory Agency. The Constitutional Court, however, revoked this law in 2004 when the provisions for a competitive electricity market and unbundling of PLN were deemed unconstitutional. At the same time, Electricity Law No. 15 was re-instated. The view that the reforms were unconstitutional was based on the interpretation of the law that electricity is a public commodity and its generation and distribution should remain under the exclusive control of the government. As one of many factors, this constitutional interpretation has contributed to preventing the further introduction of competition and independent regulatory measures in Indonesia’s electricity market.Electricity Law No. 30 of 2009 established that PLN would remain vertically integrated and control the national transmission network, such that it is the main provider of generation and the sole provider of transmission and distribution networks (although some transmission lines in remote locations can be owned by IPPs). In addition, unlike the previous law, this law did not provide for an independent system operator within Indonesia. This law also clarified that PLN would no longer have a monopoly on supply and distribution to end customers. In this regard, a licence to provide electricity for public use (IUPTL) may be granted to privately owned businesses, although in practice PLN has the “right of first priority” to supply electricity to customers and generally exercises this right.The government also implemented new regulations in 2006, 2009, 2012, and most recently in 2013, which introduced feed-in tariffs (FiTs) for the sale of electricity generated from small- and medium-scale renewable energy to PLN.

The Authority also fixes premiums and feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy sourced electricity.About 90% of domestic residences in Israel make use of solar water heating systems, which satisfies some 4% of the countrys total energy demand. The PAU established new Solar PV and Wind feed-in-tariffs (FITs) in 2009.1) The Ministry of National Infrastructure has set up a feed-in tariff for small and medium wind installations:For Wind production units of up to 10 KW, for self consuming and grid connected, the FIT is ILS 1.25/kWhFor Wind production units of 10 W up to 50 KW, for self consuming and grid connected, the FIT is ILS 1.60 /kWhThese tariffs will be reduced by 2% each year from 2011, are valid for up to a national aggregate capacity of 30 MW and guaranteed for 20 years.2) The Ministry of National Infrastructure also set up a feed-in tariff for residential and industrial solar photovoltaic installations:For PV systems of up to 50 KW for own consumption and surplus transfer to the grid, the FIT is ILS 2.01/kWh, equivalent to EUR 0.41, tariff valid for up to a national aggregate capacity of 50 MW or until 2014. From 2011 onwards, the tariff will decrease by 4% every year but for private installations up to 15kW where it will remain unchanged.For PV systems between 51 kW and 5MW, the tariff proposed by the PAU is ILS 1.49/kWh, equivalent to EUR 0.30. The tariff will be decreased by 5% each year from 201 and valid for up to a national aggregate capacity of 300 MW. Contracts are valid for twenty years and the Israel electric Company is obliged to purchase all PV produced electricity during the entire period. In July 2011, the Public Utilities Authority adjusted solar PV feed-in tariffs and extended the remuneration scheme to ground-mounted systems above 12 MW for connection to high-voltage grid. Tariffs have been set and adjusted as follows:For rooftop PV systems up to 50 kW, the FIT is ILS 1.51/kWh, tariff valid for a twenty-year period up to a 120 MW cap. The government approved an additional 110 MW through 2014 but new tariff levels are yet to be decided.For rooftop and ground-mounted PV systems between 51 kW and 12MW, the tariff is ILS 1.44/kWh until 50MW or end of 2011, ILS 1.37/kWh until an additional 65 MW or by end 2012, ILS 1.30/kWh until an additional 85 MW or end 2013 and ILS 1.23/kWh until an additionnal 100 MW or end 2014. The total cap therefore adds up to 300 MW.For ground-mounted solar systems between 12 and 60 MW, the awarded tariff is ILS 1.07/kWh, equivalent to EUR 0.21, ranges for a twenty year-period and up to a 400 MW installed capacity cap.The feed-in tariff was closed for new applications in 2013 and replaced by a net-metering system.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4952-feed-in-tariffs-for-solar-pv-and-wind-sourced-power",2009,NA,NA,"IEA"

The first component involves the renewable process for the concessions of the 400 largest dams, to be attributed on a competitive basis. The candidates who wish to exploit the dams must: - Meet stringent security requirements; - Meet energy efficiency requirements to maximise their production potential; - Meet requirements as to water quality and the impact on the environment and ecosystems. The call for candidacies will take place in 2009, with the renewal process being complete by 2012. The second aspect of the plan calls for large-scale public investment in hydropower dams, in compliance with the commitments undertaken as part of the Grenelle de lEnvironnement. These investments have the following primary aims: -To improve production capacity through new generation turbines, allowing for 30% more production; - To develop pumping stations, ensuring steady supply during peak hours without having recourse to fuel-powered electricity production. - To develop small- and micro-hydropower, including the standardisation of wind turbines. Lastly, the plan will undertake measures to ensure high water quality in streams and rivers. All aspects of the plan are to be discussed with relevant stakeholders. The planned investments will be financed through an increase in the fees paid by hydroelectric concession operating companies, which will be proposed to the parliament.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4703-hydropower-revival-plan",2009,NA,NA,"IEA"

The tariff will be determined by taking into account the following fixed-cost components:a) return on equity;b) interest on loan capital;c) depreciation;d) interest on working capital;e) operation and maintece expensesThe regulations specify the financial principles or assumptions of each component, some of which are technology specific (e.g. capital costs, interest on working capital). They also allow for project-specific tariffs to be determined for certain types of projects (e.g. municipal solid waste, hybrid solar thermal, certain solar PV and solar thermal), with relevant guidelines. The discount rate used in determining the tariff will be the average weighted cost of capital. The tariffs are defined as the levelised cost of energy, and are derived from the specific useful life of each technology. The feed-in tariff period for most renewable energy technologies is 13 years, extended to 35 years in the case of small hydro (below 5MW) and 25 years for solar PV and solar thermal. The regulations specify the capital and operation and maintece costs per MWh for several technologies: wind, small hydro, solar PV, solar thermal, non-fossil fuel based cogeneration, and biomass-based power projects. Capital costs are adjusted yearly through an indexation mechanism. For wind power, the tariff will also vary based on resource intensity.

The REFIT places an obligation on Eskom (South Africas public utility) to purchase the output from qualifying renewable energy generators at pre-determined prices based on the levelised cost of electricity. Eskoms Single Buyer Office has been appointed as the Renewable Energy Purchasing Agency (REPA), and is obliged to purchase power from licensed renewable energy generators. Licensed independent renewable energy power producers can also sell power directly to buyers outside of the REFIT mechanism. The cost of the tariff will be passed through to Eskom electricity customers.On 26 March 2009, NERSA approved REFITs Phase I which covered the following four technologies: Wind; Small hydro; Landfill Gas Methane and Concentrated Solar (CSP), Plant Parabolic trough with storage (6 hrs per day). For 2009 the REFIT are as follows:ZAR 1.25/kWh for wind;ZAR 0.94/kWh for small hydro (less than 10 MW);ZAR 0.90/kWh for landfill gas;ZAR 2.10/kWh for concentrating solar power (CSP). On 2 November 2009, REFITS Phase II tariffs were approved for six new technologies: Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) trough without storage (ZAR 3.14/kWh),CSP Tower with storage of 6 hrs per day (ZAR 2.31/kWh),Large-scale (1MW or more) grid connected PV systems (ZAR 3.94/kWh),solid biomass (ZAR 1.18/kWh)biogas (ZAR 0.96/kWh). Fossil fuels can be included in the CSP technologies, but are limited to 15% of total primary energy input.The REFIT power purchase agreement will last for 20 years, and the tariff can be adjusted yearly for inflation.For the first five years of the REFIT, a full review of the scheme will take place yearly, following which it will take place every three years. Specific license conditions for renewable energy generators include reporting, monitoring and verification requirements, and termination conditions for non-compliance with production of renewable energy.The REFIT scheme does not include off-grid power generation.Specific license conditions for renewable energy generators include reporting, monitoring and verification requirements, and termination conditions for non-compliance with production of renewable energy.

New measures to increase financial support for offshore wind will also be considered.Introducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities.New guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards. Before the schemes take effect, GBP 45 million in grants have been committed.The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will be amended or replaced, taking into account sustainability issues, to ensure transport fuels contain a rising amount of renewable biofuels.The Strategy also creates an Office for Renewable Energy Deployment (ORED) within the Department of Energy  &  Climate Change (DECC) to take forward the commitments outlined in the Strategy.In addition, the Strategy sets out areas for action in four areas.The first aims to improve planning processes to be swifter and more strategic.The second for measures to strengthen the UKs renewable energy industry, including through greater investment and work with the financial sector.The third targets improvements and investments in the electricity grid, including improved grid access, more strategic investments (including in an offshore grid and a smarter grid).Finally, the government outlines commitments for sustainable bioenergy development and use. This will act on the supply-side (woods management, energy crops, use of waste), focus on better sustainability criteria, and measures to facilitate use of biofuels and innovative bioenergy (for example, better fuel quality standards, injection of biogas into the grid, capacity of road and transport for greater biofuel use).The Strategy also commits to using part of GBP 405 million of funding for key emerging technologies for renewable energy technologies, such as wave and tidal generation, offshore wind, and advanced biofuels. The government estimates that the Strategy will provide cumulative savings of 755 MtCO2 between now and 2030, 535 MtCO2 of which will help the UK meet EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) caps, and 220 MtCO2 will provide additional CO2 reductions. Within the additional savings, 73 MtCO2 will be saved over the third carbon budget period (2018 - 2022) and deliver about a sixth of the abatement needed to meet this third budget.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4891-renewable-energy-strategy-2009",2009,NA,NA,"IEA"

These are to be reached via linear phasing, with concrete measures set for meeting the targets.  By 2011, 20% of gross energy consumption must come from renewable energy sources.The agreement includes better terms for wind turbines and other sustainable energy sources such as biomass and bio gas.Aside from significantly raising the transfer rate for electricity from land wind turbines, biomass and bio gas, the parties agree to install 400 MW from new offshore wind turbines by 2012. Plans to invest in two new 75 MW land-based facilities in 2010 and 2011 have also been announced.The deal also provides  incentives and a compensation scheme for local residents to allow land-based wind farms  to be located in their area, including a new stakeholder model.In addition, 25 million DKK per year for the next five years has been earmarked for wave and solar power  research.The effort to save energy is being considerably ramped up:  The new agreement commits Denmark to cut its energy consumption by 2% by 2012, compared with 2006 levels.  This is half a percentage point more than Denmarks current target, meaning that in 2020, energy use must have fallen by 4% compared to 2006.Hydrogen vehicles are to be tax-free  and the same applies to electric vehicles provisionally until 2012, and a pool of 35 million DKK is being set aside for electric vehicle research. The government and Danish Peoples Party would like a significant increase in research, development and demonstration efforts in energy technology to the amount of 750 million DKK in 2009 and 1 billion DKK from 2010, and this will be taken up in connection with the implementation of globalisation funding.In the case of significant deviations for the linear phasing of renewable energy and energy savings targets, the parties (Danish government and parliament) shall discuss supplementary initiatives for attaining the targets.The parties behind the agreement will receive a status report on development toward the goals and implement analyses up until 2011.

The amendment seeks to encourage lines companies to invest in permitted generation, particularly renewable generation. While electric lines companies are already able to own some types of renewable generation in unlimited quantities, the new legislation widens the definition of renewables to encompass geothermal, wind, hydro and others. This is intended to facilitate investment by local lines companies in some of the smaller projects that are not of interest to the larger generators. A line company can also sell the results of renewable energy generation in any region outside of its lines area, without restriction. It need not comply with the arms length separation rules provided that the generation is not connected to its lines. In addition a lines company may invest in ""new"" (ie. generation commissioned after 8 August 2001) renewable generation which is connected to its lines, of any size. This renewable generation does not count towards the lines companys connected generation cap. This also applies to generators that are partly renewable and partly fossil fuel based, provided that fossil fuels provide no more than 20% of the fuel for the generator in any 12 month period. The lines company may sell this electricity to the customers within its lines area.

In this case approval must be obtained from the Energy Regulatory Commission.The maximum tariffs are technology and capacity specific, applying to wind, biomass and hydroelectricity, and will apply for 15 years from the date of the plant's commissioning.Feed-in tariffs are as follows:Wind power: USD 0.09/kWh maximum tariff up to 50 MW (single wind farm); for capacity greater than 50MW, tariff to be negotiated on a commercial basis. The tariff applies to the first 150MW of wind power capacity developed.Biomass derived electricity: Up to 40 MW, USD 0.07 maximum firm power tariff (for the first 150MW developed) USD 0.045 maximum non-firm power tariff (for the first 50MW developed); for capacity greater than 40MW, tariff to be negotiated on a commercial basis. Where biomass is used together with fossil fuels for the purpose of producing firm power it must contribute at least 70% of the annual fuel consumption, otherwise the non-firm power tariff shall apply.Small hydro power: From 50kW to 1MW, maximum firm power tariff of USD 0.12 and non-firm power tariff of USD 0.10 From 1 to 5MW, maximum firm power tariff of USD 0.10 and non-firm power tariff of USD 0.08 From 5 to 10MW, maximum firm power tariff of USD 0.08 and non-firm power tariff of USD 0.06 The tariff applies to the first 100MW of firm power generated, and the first 50MW of non-firm power generated. For capacity greater than 10MW, the tariff is to be negotiated on a commercial basis.Investors interested in becoming power producers must submit an expression of interest (EOI) to the Ministry of Energy. The EOI is reviewed by a panel comprising representatives of the Ministry of Energy, the grid operator and the energy regulator.

"5213","Finland","FIN",NA,NA,"Long-term Climate and Energy Strategy","Approximately 80% of the greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming originate in energy production and consumption, including transport. Therefore, climate and energy policy have become closely entwined in the past few years. The Finnish Government has submitted a report to Parliament on climate and energy policy in 2001 and 2005. Since the latest report, international and EU climate and energy political objectives and obligations have changed to such an extent that, in 2007, a policy position was set down in the Government Programme of Prime Minister Vanhanens second Cabinet, stating that the Government would draw up a long-term climate and energy strategy at the beginning of its current term, to define the principal objectives and means of Finlands climate and energy policy for the next few decades, within the context of the European Union and its objectives. It was decided that the Strategy would be submitted to Parliament in the form of a report. The report was prepared under the steering of the Governments Ministerial Working Group on Climate and Energy Policy. The preparatory body for the Ministerial Working Group has been the Climate and Energy Policy Network, comprising representatives of several ministries, including the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Education, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Prime Ministers Office, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of the Environment. The report consists of an outline and strategy texts, including background information, and four appendices. On the other hand, the strategy proper describes the changes that have taken place in the international operating environment, and presents the Governments outlines for energy and climate policy in the forthcoming years, alongside proposals for key measures for the attainment of the EUs objectives regarding the promotion of renewable energy, the enhancement of efficiency in energy consumption, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The strategy sets targets for final energy consumption and electricity consumption in 2020, aiming to keep them relatively stable as compared to current (2008) levels. Final energy consumption is to reach 310 TWh (almost equal to the current level) and electricity consumption is to reach 98 TWh (slightly higher than the 2008 level of just under 90 TWh). The strategy presents two scenarios: the baseline in compliance with current measures and development, and the objective, meeting the EUs and national objectives. According to the scenarios, for 2020, electricity consumption would, at the baseline, be 103 TWh (terawatt-hours), primary energy consumption 479 TWh, final energy consumption 347 TWh and greenhouse gas emissions 89 Mt CO2-eqv. (million equivalent carbon dioxide tonnes) and corresponding emissions outside the emission trading sector, 36 Mt CO2-eqv. According to the objective, in 2020, electricity consumption will equal 98 TWh, primary energy consumption 430 TWh, final energy consumption 310 TWh and emissions outside the emission trading sector 30 Mt CO2-eqv. Emissions within industries included in emission trading are specified in accordance with EU-wide emission trading, which is under modification. The strategy aims for a marked increase in the share of indigenously generated energy, as well as improved energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy. The share of renewable energy is targeted to increase to 38% of total final energy consumption. This will require an increase in the use of wood-based energy, waste fuels, heat pumps, biogas and wind energy. The use of forest chips is to be increased by two or three times over current levels, and by 2020, some 6TWh of wind energy to be harnessed for use, which would entail the construction of a minimum of 700 new 3 MW wind power plants.

Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Maryland joined RGGI in 2007, bringing the number of participating states to ten. RGGI sets a cap on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel-fired power plants with a capacity of 25 MW or higher, and allows sources to trade emissions allowances. The RGGI GHG emissions cap, state emissions caps and allowance distribution, and auction design were developed collaboratively between the RGGI states. RGGI is composed of individual CO2 Budget Trading Programs in each of the ten participating states. These ten programmes are implemented through state regulations, based on a RGGI Model Rule, and are linked through CO2 allowance reciprocity. Regulated power plants will be able to use a CO2 allowance issued by any of the ten participating states to demonstrate compliance with the state programme governing their facility. Taken together, the ten individual state programmes will function as a single regional compliance market for carbon emissions.  The programme will begin by capping emissions at current levels in 2009 and then reducing emissions 10% by 2018.  The compliance period begins on 1 January 2009, at which time allowances will become tradable as power plants adjust their GHG emissions levels. The program will include 233 fossil fuel-fired power stations and factories. Power generators must hold allowances covering their CO2 emissions; each allowance allows the emission of one short ton of carbon dioxide emissions. These allowances are to be auctioned, and the proceeds used by the states to support renewable energy, energy efficiency and other low carbon intensity power solutions.  Before the start of the compliance period, pre-compliance emissions allowance auctions are to be held for the 2009-11 period. The first auction took place on 25 September 2008, with 12 565 387 CO2 emissions allowances from Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont offered for bid to parties. These included entities with compliance obligations, allowance brokers, investors, and environmental groups. 59 separate entities submitted bids. The clearing price was USD 3.07, and the auction generated over USD 38 million in proceeds.

The Act was enacted in 1979 in the light of the oil shock. This comprehensive act covers all sectors as follows: Energy management in manufacturing, commercial and transportation sectors; energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances (Top Runner Program); energy efficiency standards for houses and buildings. In 2008 the act was revised to strengthen measures to enhance energy efficiency, including those for the commercial sector. Also in this revision, sectoral approaches used in domestic regulation was introduced, to be implemented as of April 2009. a) Regulatory Expansion in the Commercial Sector Before the revision, only large scale factories and workplaces were targeted to enforce the energy management. The revision expanded this site-specific requirement to a company-wide one; a company consuming above a certain amount of energy must implement energy efficiency measures for all of its factories and workplaces. This also expands coverage beyond manufacturing sites, to offices and franchise companies running convenience stores. A new regulation was also added, requiring that a board member be appointed to be in charge of energy management for the whole company. b) Sectoral Approaches as National Regulation (Sectoral Benchmarking) Sectoral approaches have for the first time been introduced as a domestic regulatory measure. Sectoral benchmarks are being established for certain sub-sectors, initially in energy intensive industries. Indicators are established for companies to benchmark their energy efficiency level against others within the same sub-sector, and medium- and long-term targets are set (to be achieved around 2015-2020). Currently, each factory and workplace is required to achieve annually on average 1 % reduction or more in energy intensity. The revision adds benchmarking indicators and associated targets to the above in certain sub-sectors: iron and steel, cement, and electricity suppliers. Targets are set at the energy efficiency level of the best performing companies (top 10%-20%) in each sub-sector based on the average value and standard deviation. Companies covered by the scheme must submit yearly reports on the status of the benchmarking indicator, in addition to the ratio of energy intensity reduction and on the implementation of an energy management system. Based on the companies reports, the government may take necessary measures when it sees substantial lack of efforts in reference to the targets. The measures include guidance, publication of the companys name, and order (with a fine imposed when the company does not adhere to the order). The indicators average value and standard deviation for each sub-sector will also be published by the government based on company reports.

In order to meet this target, the reform and continuation of the MEP schemes was decided. The two previous schemes were combined into a new scheme called SDE (stimulering duurzame energie). In August 2007 the Dutch government submitted the scheme for approval under EC Treaty state aid rules. In December the European Commission auhorised the aid scheme, to stimulate production of renewable energy and Combined Heat and Power. The extra available budget for the SDE is estimated at EUR 2,144 million. Unlike the MEP, the SDE is fully financed by direct government support. The regulation was published on 3 March 2008, and subsidy requests can be submitted as of 1 April 2008 from SenterNovem, the Ministry of Economic Affairs agency. Differences from the MEP are that projects are selected through tendering, and that the subsidy amounts will be corrected and vary depending on fossil fuel energy prices. Also, hydro projects are not eligible, though the scheme applies also to biogas. The scheme can be called a ""modified feed-in tariff""; a fixed subsidy is guaranteed, as in a feed-in tariff, with an option for a higher price per kWh if the electricity price goes above the subsidy ceiling. Thus, renewable energy producers are provided a fixed price per kWh. The scheme acts as a premium if the electricity price goes below the feed-in tariff. However, if the market electricity price is at or above the feed-in tariff price, no subsidy is received from the government. For example, the estimated subsidy amount in 2008 for sewage-gas and waste water electricity, as well as high efficiency waste generation is zero, since the wholesale market price is expected to be higher than the estimated cost of production from these technologies. Offshore wind is not eligible for subsidies in 2008 and 2009; the first tender will be in 2010. In addition, annual expenditures are capped by technology. Estimated yearly caps are calculated based on capacity installed and estimated installations from 2008 to 2011. These are: EUR 1 million for biogas from sewage and waste water; EUR 19 million for small-scale PV (0.6 kWp-3.5 kWp); EUR 68 million for biomass CHP, co-digestion of food industry waste and manure; EUR 119 million for off-shore wind; EUR 129 million for on-shore wind.

The strategy follows two and a half years of work involving stakeholders from government, business, civil society and labour. It is based on findings and policy recommendations stemming from the South African governments long-term mitigation scenario (LTMS) process on climate change, launched in 2006. The LTMS presented three strategic options to deviate from business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions trajectories, which the current vision, strategic direction and framework aim to implement. The governments vision is to limit global temperature increase to 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels, through a policy response comprising six themes. Theme 1: Greenhouse gas emission reductions and limits. - South Africas emissions trajectory is to follow a growth, plateau and decline trajectory. Emissions are to stop growing at the latest by 2020-25, to stabilise for up to ten years, and then to decline in absolute terms. Climate change mitigation measures are to be informed by, measured and monitored against this trajectory. Theme 2: Build on, strengthen and/or scale up current initiatives. - Current energy efficiency and electricity demand-side management initiatives and interventions are to be scaled-up and reinforced through available regulatory instruments and other appropriate mechanisms, including being made mandatory. - The governments energy efficiency policies and strategies are to be continuously reviewed and amended to reflect more ambitious national targets aligned with the LTMS - The Treasury is to study the introduction of a carbon tax, starting at low levels and escalating to higher levels by 2018-20, while being sensitive to higher and lower tax levels. The Treasury is to report to the Cabinet on its findings. Theme 3: Implementing the ""Business Unusual"" Call for Action. Key sectors are identified as ""business unusual"" sectors, with specific actions and measures to be taken. - The renewable energy sector has been identified as a key ""business unusual"" growth sector and policies and measures are to be put in place to meet a more ambitious national target for renewable energy. - The transport sector has also been identified as another key ""business unusual"" growth sector and policies and measures are to be put in place to meet ambitious and mandatory national targets for the reduction of GHG emissions from this sector. - The government is to promote the transition to a low-carbon economy and society, with all policy and other decisions that may have an impact on South Africas greenhouse gas emissions taking this commitment into account. Theme 4: Preparing for the future. - Increasing support for new and ambitious research and development targets being set, especially in the field of carbon-friendly technologies - with the focus on the renewable energy and transport sectors. - Using both formal and informal forms of education and outreach to encourage the behavioural changes required to support efficient and effective implementation of the climate change response policy. Theme 5: Vulnerability and Adaptation - Continue to identify and describe South Africas vulnerability to climate change, to prioritise adaptation interventions, while identifying who is to drive them and how they are to be monitored. Affected government departments are to ensure that adaptation to climate change in their sectors are included as departmental key performance areas. - The government is to pro-actively build on the knowledge base and capacity to adapt to climate change, including by enhancing early warning and disaster reduction systems, and in the provision of various services. Theme 6: Alignment, Coordination and Cooperation - The roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders, particularly the organs of state in all three spheres of government, will be clearly defined and articulated. - The structures req","https://www.iea.org/policies/1283-vision-strategic-direction-and-framework-for-climate-policy",2008,NA,NA,"IEA"

This royal decree supersedes Royal Decree 436/2004 of March 2004, establishing new tariffs and premiums for each kind of facility covered and incorporating renewable energy, waste to energy, hybrid systems and cogeneration plants into the special regime.The cost of the regime is borne by the grid operator, who can pass on costs to consumers.The grid operators costs are balanced monthly, and where there is a deficit this is covered by the National Energy Committee (CNE).The new scheme generally applies to all technologies, with technology-specific and capacity-specific limits, as well as a combined feed-in tariff and feed-in premium scheme. Facilities with high system efficiency, or that use reactive energy, receive a bonus. Renewable energy facilities are covered by the special regime only if their installed capacity does not exceed 100 MW (50 MW for hydro facilities). Up to 50MW, operators can choose between receiving a feed-in tariff price, or a feed-in premium paid on top of the market electricity price. The feed-in tariffs are paid during the entire time of a systems operation, though these are reduced after a specified number of years. This period is 25 years PV, ocean and hydro systems, 20 years for wind and geothermal, and 15 years for biomass systems. Between 50 and 100MW, operators receive a bonus amount for the electricity produced. Solar PV systems are exempt from this arrangement; they receive guaranteed feed-in tariffs which are adjusted every quarter for new systems.In September 2008, new tariffs and a new cap were established for solar PV. Systems registered prior to 29 September 2008 are eligible for a feed-in tariff of between approximately EUR cents 23/kWh and EUR cents 44/kWh (depending on system size). The installation cap of 371MW established by the law has been adjusted upwards to 500MW as of 2009, while the feed-in tariff has been reduced to EUR cents 32/kWh for ground systems and EUR cents 34/kWh for rooftop systems. A registry of systems eligible to receive the new tariffs has been established as of January 2009.Guarantees for processing new applications: The decree provides that those requesting new production facilities in the special regime must present a guarantee for an amount equivalent to EUR 500/kW for the photovoltaic facilities or EUR 20/kW for all other facilities. Facilities holding a certificate for the definitive start-up of service before 1 January 2008 that opt to transfer, before 1 January 2009, electricity to the system in return for a regulated tariff will continue to be covered by Royal Decree 436/2004 for the lifetime of that facility.Facilities holding a certificate for the definitive start up of service before 1 January 2008 that opt to sell, before 1 January 2009, energy on the market will also continue to be covered by Royal Decree 436/2004 - until 31 December 2012.

In terms of Clean Energy, various objectives and measures are outlined, through four lines of action for energy efficiency, renewable energy, demand management, and research development and innovation. All of these call for the creation of new financing mechanisms. In energy efficiency, the strategy seeks to ensure efficiency improvements are beneficial overall, by removing fare structures that encourage consumption, and putting in place regulatory measures to prevent increased demand for energy should efficiency lead to reduced energy costs. Information campaigns, for both companies and consumers, will be undertaken, and voluntary commitments by companies encouraged. For Climate Change, specific action lines across 11 broad areas are outlined, which are: i) Institutional cooperation, ii) Flexible mechanisms, iii) International Cooperation and cooperation with developing countries, iv) Emission Trading, v) Sinks, vi) CO2 Capture and Storage, vii) Sectors concerned with diffuse pollution, viii) Adaptation to climate change , ix) Information and public awareness, x) Research, development and technological innovation and xi) Horizontal Measures. Within these, 198 specific measures are detailed, which in turn provide for the 75 indicators the government will use to measure progress. A variety of measures to make the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme more effective are put forward, aiming at greater harmonisation and stability, an expansion of the scheme to other gas and/or sectors, and connection of registries. Measures are also planned for CCS, including a scoping study and analysis, the design of a suitable legal framework, and the monitoring and co-ordination of various CCS initiatives across the country. Sectors concerned with diffuse pollution are those which do not fall under the GHG emissions trading scheme, namely transport, waste, residential, commercial and institutional sectors, farming and fluorinated gases. Regarding the latter, Spain will transpose EU Regulation 842/2006 and EU Directive 2006/40/EC to establish limits and controls on certain fluorinated gas emissions. In transport, various measures target better infrastructure and territorial planning and modal change. In addition, the use of efficient building and power generation technologies, as well as renewable energy sources, are to be used when developing transport facilities. Other efficiency measures include eco-driving programmes, improved energy labels for vehicles, as well as integration of energy efficiency criteria in administrative contracts to increase the number of clean-air vehicles in the public vehicle fleet. In the residential, commercial and institutional sectors, most measures will concentrate on buildings; both new buildings, through strengthening thermal building code requirements and promoting energy performance certificates, as well as existing buildings, through incentives for renovation. Measures will also encourage the use of efficient appliances, heating equipment and light bulb. Measures targeting large energy consumers and SMEs are also envisaged. Regarding renewable energy, measures will extend the use of solar thermal panels in new housing projects as well as non-residential buildings and public facilities. In addition, the use of wood as heating fuel will be promoted. High priority support will be given to biomethanisation and the recovery of biogas from landfills. A special set of measures aim at improving public awareness of climate change issues, including good practice manuals, teaching materials, and agreements signed between research organisations, universities, associations and administrations to cooperate to popularise research and reports on climate change issues.","https://www.iea.org/policies/52-spanish-strategy-on-climate-change-and-clean-energy-2007-2012-2020",2007,NA,NA,"IEA"

It also seeks to promote, by granting priority to the generation of electrical power from RES and high efficiency cogeneration of electricity and heat plants in the internal electricity market. In the act, RES are listed as: wind energy, solar energy, wave energy, tidal energy, biomass, gases released in sanitary landfills and biological treatment plants, biogases, geothermal energy, and hydraulic energy utilized in hydroelectric stations. The act: - regulates the production of electricity using RES and high efficiency cogeneration; - regulates the installation and operation of power generation facilities using RES and high efficiency cogeneration - provides for the levels of feed in tariffs for electricity sourced for renewable energy; - provides for the promotion of power production from photovoltaic stations via the establishment of a photo-voltatic deployment programme; - establishes the institutional framework for the promotion of RES and high effciency cogeneration, including the publication of a national report on the topic, under the authority of the Minister of Development. Article 13 of the act provides for the feed-in tariffs listed below (to be priced monthly on the basis of the price in Euro per MWh of electricity taken up by the System or the Network). In each case, the first figure listed is the price for the interconnected system, while the second figure is the price for the non-interconnected islands. (a) wind energy: 73, 84.6 (b) wind energy from sea wind farms: 90 (c) hydraulic energy exploited in small-scale hydroelectric plants with an installed capacity up to 15 MWe: 73, 84.6 (d) Solar energy utilized in photovoltaic units with an installed capacity less than, or equal to 100 kW peak, and which will be installed in a lawfully owned or possessed property or in adjacent properties of the same owner or lawful possessor: 450, 500 (e) Solar energy exploited in photovoltaic units with an installed capacity of over 100 kW peak: 400, 450 (f) Solar energy exploited in units employing a technology other than that of photovoltaics with an installed capacity up to 5 MWe: 250, 270 (g) Solar energy exploited in units employing a technology other than that of photovoltaics with an installed capacity of over 5 MWe: 230, 250 (h) Geothermal energy, biomass, gases released from sanitary landfills and biological treatment plants and biogases: 73, 84.6 (i) Miscellaneous RES: 73, 84.6 (j) High-efficiency cogeneration of heat and electricity: 73, 84.6 In addition, the 9% VAT is not included.

The Tariff Policy included certain provisions regarding renewable energy and cogeneration. The appropriate electricity commission is to fix a minimum percentage for purchase of energy from these sources, taking into account resource availability and impact on tariffs. Percentages for energy purchase were made applicable for tariffs to be determined by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) by 1 April 2006. Procurement by distribution companies is to be done at preferential tariffs, determined by the appropriate commission, to encourage non-conventional energy technologies to eventually compete with conventional ones. Such procurement is to be done through a competitive bidding process. In cases where procurement is not through competitive bidding, the Central Commission is to lay down guidelines for pricing non-firm power, particularly from non-conventional sources. Non-firm power refers to power supplied under a commitment having limited or no assured availability.The new policy was developed in accordance with frameworks established by The Electricity Act 2003 and the National Electricity Policy.

The TBC applies to new construction, except for technically simple structures of negligible constructional consequence not designated for residential or public use.The TBC also applies to the extension, modification, alteration or renovation works that are carried out on existing buildings. The Technical Code includes a set of Basic Documents, BD, for complying with the its basic requirements. These documents are to be updated in accordance with technical advancements and social requirements, and shall be approved regularly. Among the various BD is the Basic Energy Saving Document, which aims to obtain a rational use of energy required for buildings, reducing their consumption to sustainable limits, and ensuring that part of this consumption comes from renewable sources of energy, thanks to their design, construction, use and maintenance characteristics. This Basic Document comprises the following sections: HE.1: Limiting energy demand (heating and air conditioning). HE.2: Efficiency of heating/air-conditioning systems. HE.3: Energy efficiency of lighting systems. HE.4: Minimum solar contribution to the hot water supply. HE.5: Minimum photovoltaic contribution to the electrical power supply. The TBE contributes to the transposition of the Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings, in terms of the minimum energy requirements that must be met.   In order to comply with the Directive 2010/31/UE on energy efficiency in buildings, amending Directive 2002/91/EC, with regard to the energy efficiency requirements in buildings, the CTE DB-HE Basic Document on energy saving has been updated through the approval of the Order FOM/1635/2013 . This involves an increase in energy efficiency and renewable energies different from the ones mentioned in the above Basic Document, and also introduces a new section: HE.0: limitation of energy consumption. The energy consumption for the fitting-out, if applicable, of buildings or parts of them which, given that they are permanently open for reason of their use, will exclusively be met with energy coming from renewable energies. These demands shall be checked using a calculation procedure pursuant to the specifications established to the purpose. All the above leads to the partial transposition of Directive 2010/31/EU in terms of the energy efficiency requirements in buildings, as provided in its articles 3, 4, 5, 6 & 7, as well as Directive 2009/28/EC, in terms of a demand of some minimum energy levels coming from renewable energies in buildings, as set forth in its article 13. In like manner, the updating of the DB-HE Basic Document on energy saving makes up a first approach to the objective of Directive 2010/31/EU of achieving nearly zero-energy buildings – before 31 December 2010 in all new buildings and before the end of 2018 in new buildings for public use.  More recently, the CTE DB- HE (Energy Sving) and HS (Salubrity) have been updated through the Order FOM/588/2017 in accordance with the Directive 2010/31/EU.

It was meant for photovoltaic plants connected to the grid with a nominal capacity higher than 1 kWp realized by natural and legal persons, condominiums and public bodies. The decree provided a set of tariffs, valid for a period of 20 years, with a bonus in case of high degree of PV integration in the buildings. Three types of systems were considered: not integrated, partially integrated and fully integrated. For 2010 the premiums ranged from a minimum of EUR 0.346/kWh (for not integrated plants with P>20 kW) to a maximum of EUR 0.471/kWh (for fully integrated plants with plants a capacity 1=P=3). A tariff bonus of 5% was provided to self-producers, public schools and public hospitals, installations integrated to building substituting asbestos roofs, municipalities with less than 5 000 inhabitants. Plants with a capacity lower than 20 kWp could further benefit from on the on-spot trading service. Furthermore, this feed-in premium scheme promoted energy efficiency measures in buildings providing an additional bonus in case energy efficiency interventions in the buildings were implemented; on the basis of the energy saving level achieved, it was possible to obtain a maximum increase of the 30% of the base tariff. Producers got, in addition to the premium, the price of the electricity sold either on the market or through bilateral contracts. The feed-in premium scheme for PV plants was again revised by the Ministerial Decree of 6 August 2010. It incentivizes PV plants commissioned after December 31st, 2010, connected to the grid and with a nominal capacity higher than 1 kWp. Natural and legal persons, owners of housing units and/or buildings and public bodies could apply the support scheme. The 2010 decree provided a set of tariffs, valid for a period of 20 years, granted to the following power plants: - Installations on buildings, other PV plants, integrated PV plants with innovative characteristics (i.e. plants that use special components and modules, developed specifically to replace architectural elements); concentrating photovoltaic system; photovoltaic plants with technological innovation (i.e. the one that uses modules and components which are characterized by significant technological innovations). The decree also provides, in addition to a national target for PV power installed by 2020 of 8, 000MW, a power limit for each power plant category that can be incentivized: - 3, 000 MW for photovoltaic plants; - 300 MW for Photovoltaic plants which are architecturally integrated with innovative characteristics; - 200 MW Concentrating photovoltaic system. The provisions set by this last ministerial decree applied to PV plants commissioned until 31.5.2011 as according to the provisions of the Legislative decree No.28/2011. The Ministerial Decree of May 5th, 2011 sets out provisions for promoting PV plants with a capacity = 1 kW and commissioned between June 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2016. It also establishes a 23,000 MW cap for the national capacity installed which corresponds to an indicative cumulative annual cost of 6-7 billions of euros. Once achieved one of these minimum values set either for the national capacity cap or for the cumulative annual cost, a further Ministerial Decree will be issued to revise the PV support scheme. The decree establishes a set of tariffs differentiated by capacity and category of PV plants, distinguishing between PV on building and ""other"" PV plants. It also provides specific premiums to incentivize the use of photovoltaic modules that use non-conventional and special components, developed specifically to complement architectural elements and replace the buildings, in PV plants with a capacity = 1 kW and = 5 MW. May apply to such tariffs natural and legal persons, public entities and owners of houses and/or buildings. Furthermore, the Ministerial Decree introduces a feed-in premium scheme to incentivize Concentrating PV systems. Only legal persons and public entities may apply to such specific tariffs. All the tariffs set by the ministerial decree are granted to electricity produced as a bonus on top of the electricity selling price. As of 1.1.2013, the tariffs will be granted to the electricity injected into the grid modifying the previous feed-in premium scheme in a feed-in tariff scheme. However, specific tariffs will also be provided for the electricity consumed on-site.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4902-old-feed-in-premium-for-photovoltaic-systems-i-ii-iii-iv-conto-energia",2005,NA,NA,"IEA"

Industrial CO2 emitters are allocated a total amount of emissions, and reducing emissions generates credits which can be sold to other emitters needing more. The Scheme covered CO2 emissions from energy use and some industrial processes, and only covered installations not subject to the CO2 Tax (see separate entry) or special agreements on emissions reductions with the State Pollution Control Authority. According to this agreement, existing process industry plants agreed to commit themselves to a 20% reduction in all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2007, compared to 1990 levels. There was some overlap between installations subject to this agreement and those covered by the emission trading scheme, notably CO2 emissions from refineries and cement. New installations were covered by the emissions trading scheme and not the 20% GHG emissions reduction agreement. Accordingly, emissions trading applied to CO2 emissions in connection with: - Energy production (Combustion installations above 20 MW), - Mineral oil refineries, - Coke production, - Production and processing of iron and steel, including roasting and sintering of iron ore, - Production of cement, lime, glass, glass fibre and ceramic products. The scheme covered 51 installations, accounting for approximately 10-15% of total GHG emissions. In 2008, Norway linked its emissions trading system with the EU ETS (see separate entry).","https://www.iea.org/policies/4282-domestic-emissions-trading-scheme-2005-2007",2005,NA,NA,"IEA"

The Plan aims to maintain the governments commitment to meet at least 12% of total energy use from renewable sources by 2010, while incorporating other indicative targets - 29.4% of electricity generated from renewable sources and 5.75% (more accurately 5.83%) of transport fuel needs to be met from biofuels by 2010 - adopted after the previous Plan came into effect. Certain details on specific provisions are indicated below. Wind: As planned, wind energy would generate up to 20,155 MW by 2010. This was an increase on the previous target of from 13,000 MW by 2010. To encourage this growth from present capacity, the plan noted the importance of grid access for renewables and ameliorating the transmission systems management. Solar: The plan provided for 4-5 million square metres of solar generating capacity by 2010. It also promoted the use of photovoltaic collectors in buildings through public subsidies from local and central agencies, with official backing for solar installations. The objective for solar power installations was increased to 400 MW by 2010, compared with the previous objective of 144 MW. In October 2007, the government announced a further increase of this target - namely 1,200MW of installation capacity by 2010. In making the announcement, the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce announced that figures from the Comisión Nacional de la Energía showed that 85% of the original quota had been met, and that the full 400MW was likely to be installed by the end of 2007. The plan also aims to have 500 MW of thermoelectric solar power generation capacity by 2010. Biomass: As established in the PER, biomass-generated electricity should total 2,000 MW per year by 2010: 3568 Ktoe, including a target of 1552 Ktoe from co-firing. To complement the PER in achieving this target, the Spanish government passed Law 24/2005 in November 2005 to favor biomass over traditional power sources. Biofuels: The Spanish government also raised its target for the production of bio-ethanol and bio-diesel to 2.2 million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) by 2010, from an initial 0.5 million toe. The plan also provided for EUR 2.855 to promote biofuels through fiscal incentives. The Plan set common standards for the administrative processes of Spains autonomous regions and established a single office to oversee renewables and cogeneration operations. The plan is indicative, meaning that it is not binding upon the actors in the energy system. Funds for feed-in tariffs comprise EUR 4.956 billion of the total budget. The energy industry is expected to finance 77% of the overall cost of the renewable energy plan, and other private sector industries another 20% and the government, the remainder. Tax incentives will also be offered.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4431-renewable-energy-plan-2005-2010",2005,NA,NA,"IEA"

Running from 2004 to 2015, the programme includes three main missions: PERADOC first advises regional and local institutions on how to improve energy policies, create suitable institutions to promote rural electrification, integrate private energy producers and stimulate energy generation from renewable sources. Second, the programme supports a sustainable and diversified domestic fuel supply in order to halt deforestation and improve indoor cooking facilities. The programme assists local populations in improving their wood consumption efficiency by subsidising improved charcoal that burns more cleanly and efficiently, and is less harmful to health. Third, PERACOD tackles the concrete needs of rural electrification. On a one hand, PERACOD targets electricity grid expansion and increased electrification rates from 16% in 2007 to 60% by 2022. In a partnership with the Rural Electrification Agency (ASER), PERACOD participates to the Rural Electrification Emergency Plan 2008-2012 that will connect 228 445 households by 2012. On the other hand, PERACOD supports small-scale and individual rural electrification initiatives by subsidising up to 80% of initial investment, with a major focus on Solar Home Systems. Eventually, PERACOD supports the development of income-generating energy activities. In villages benefiting from such project, energy saving bulbs have been distributed, solar lighting is deployed in public and community buildings -church, mosque, health and education centers- and thermal motors for mills and drills are progressively being replaced by RE functioning engines.

According to the system, an extra surcharge is paid to new, onshore wind-turbines on the condition that the owner is in possession of a scrapping certificate for a wind turbine with installed power of 450 kW or less which was decommissioned between 15 December 2004 and 15 December 2010. The surcharge is paid to factory-new wind turbines connected to the grid between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010.As a consequence of the energy policy agreement of 21 February 2008 between Denmarks Liberal Party, the Conservative Peoples Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Socialist People's Party, the Social Liberal Party and New Alliance (now Liberal Alliance) on Danish energy policy for the years 2008-2011, the scrapping scheme was prolonged so that scrapping certificates can still be earned until 15 December 2010 for new wind turbines grid connected before 31 December 2010.Changes have been enacted in the Promotion of Renewable Energy Act.The price supplement is DKK 0.12 per kWh and is granted for electricity production corresponding to 12,000 full-load hours for double the installed capacity of the decommissioned wind turbine. However, if the total amount of this price supplement of DKK 0.12 per kWh, the market price and the ordinary price supplement of DKK 0.10 per kWh exceeds DKK 0.48 per kWh, the price supplement of DKK 0.12 per kWh will be reduced.The energy policy agreement of 21 February 2008 moreover means that wind turbines connected to the grid on 21 February 2008 or later are granted an extra price supplement of DKK 0.08 per kWh for electricity production corresponding to 12,000 full-load hours for double the amount of the installed capacity of the decommissioned wind turbine. The price supplement is fixed so that it is granted irrespective of the spot market price.Owners of wind turbines grid connected from 21 February 2008 until and including 31 December 2010 may, instead of the price supplement of DKK 0.08 per kWh, choose to receive a price supplement of DKK 0.12 per kWh, provided the sum of the price supplement and the spot market price on a monthly basis do not exceed a limit of DKK 0.38 per kWh.The scrapping certificates are issued by the system operator, Energinet.dk. Scrapping certificates may only be issued within a pool which corresponds to a total capacity of decommissioned wind turbines of 175MW. The system operator will publish a list regularly of the number of certificates which have been issued and the number of advance commitments which have been given.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4460-replacement-scheme-for-wind-turbines-on-land-scrapping-certificates",2004,NA,NA,"IEA"

The programme is coordinated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy, managed by Eletrobrás and implemented by the distribution companies under its control, and privatised and federal power supply companies with the participation of regional committees. The programmes overall ambition is to provide access to electricity to the 12 million people who live without it, 10 million of them being in rural areas. By the end of 2008, the goal is for a total of 1.7 million non-electrified households to have access to electricity.

Approximately 72% of the programmes total funding comes from two sources, the Reserva Global de Reversão (RGR) and the Conta de Desenvolvimento Energético (CDE). The RGR is a fund providing loans, collected from the concession fees and fines paid by energy supply companies. The CDE is a fund providing subsidies, collected from a tariff paid by all electricity consumers. The remaining funding is generally divided equally between the federal states and municipalities (14%) and the power supply companies (14%). However, where initial electrification rates are very low, up to 90% of the supply companys total investment will be subsidised through national funds.

The MEP differentiates the level of producer support for renewable energy technologies. In 2006, the highest support level was granted for offshore wind, PV, small (< 50 MW) stand-alone biomass installations, hydro, wave and tide energy (EUR cents 9.7/kWh ). The lowes tariff was EUR cents1.3 per kWh for landfill gas and digestion. Onshore wind, large biomass and mixed biomass received premiums between these rates. For onshore wind, the production support is for a maximum of 18 000 full load hours in ten years. As of 2007, the feed-in tariff was financed through the national budget, a departure from previous funding through a levy on all connections to the electricity grid in the Netherlands. This levy was for 100%, compensated by means of a reduction of the REB on fossil energy consumption.

"5530","Austria","AUT",NA,NA,"Green Electricity Act","The Green Electricity Act, which entered into force on the 1st of January 2003, made way for a uniform country wide regulation of the support schemes for Green Power. The Green Electricity Act is aimed at: - A single federal support payment scheme for ""other"" green power, small hydro and combined heat and power (CHP) was introduced; - A uniform feed-in tariff scheme was introduced for all eligible renewable energy sources; - The minimum target contribution from small hydro in 2008 was raised from 8 % to 9 % of total supply; - The minimum target contribution from ""other"" green power in 2008 was set at 4 %; - Increasing the share of ""green"" power from 70% (status in 1997) to the indicative target of 78.1% in 2010 in accordance with Directive 2001/77/EC; - The targets for ""other"" green power and small hydro relate to Austria as a whole; - Uniform feed-in tariffs and surcharges (support contributions) were introduced for the whole of Austria. In the case of small hydro power this resulted in a changeover from a certificate to a feed-in tariff system on 1 January 2003. Other changes include: - The certificate system for small-scale hydroelectric power stations expires at the end of 2002. - As of 1 January 2003, there will no longer be a quota obligation for the network operators and therefore also no more compensation payments as of this date. - All operators of green plants have the right to a listing of the certification of origin by the network operators. - The electricity identification system, which regulates the identification of the source of energy used to generate the electricity on bills, will be standardised after a transitional period up to 1 July 2004 and then all electricity dealers must identify a standard composition on all their end consumer bills (""standard dealer mix""). Large parts of the Green Electricity Act (GEA) are designed to support the production of green electricity via a feed-in tariff, which is financed by the Austrian electricity consumers through a clearance mechanism. The 2006 amendment to the GEA created a designated settlement centre, the OeMAG Abwicklungsstelle für Ökostrom (OeMAG), which pays a feed-in tariff to the producers of green electricity. Electricity distributors are then obliged to purchase a certain amount of green electricity from OeMAG at a fixed price, which is lower than the feed-in tariff. This price is set by the Energy Control Commission through Regulations. The difference between the feed-in tariff and the purchase price for electricity distributors are borne by Austrian electricity consumers, who pay a fixed lump sum to OeMAG (""Zählpunktpauschale""), which varies according to the grid level on which they are connected to the network. The OeMAG has a maximum annual budget to purchase renewable electricity (EUR 17 million/year from 2007-11). The feed-in tariff rate is determined by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Environment and Water Management, as well as the Länder (Feed-in Tariff Order, FLG II No. 508/2002 of December 2002). Amendments to the Act in 2006 mean that after conclusion of the contract, the green power plant has to be put into operation within 24 months, after this time limit feed-in tariffs can be claimed, namely tariffs valid at the date on which the contract with OeMAG was concluded: From the beginning of operation for the duration of 10 years; in the 11th year 75% respectively in the 12th year 50% of these tariffs will be compensated, at least the market price according to § 20 of the Green Electricity Act. 13th till 24th year: Purchase guarantee to the market tariff according to § 20 of the Green Electricity Act minus expenses for control energy (separate depending on wind energy or other energy sources).

This law is accepted under reserve of the EU. On the photovoltaic front, the Renewable Energy Law, EEG (erneuerbare Energiegesetz), passed in April 2000, stated that only electricity from the first 350MW of photovoltaic plant capacity installed was eligible for premium payments. The feed-in tariff was originally EUR Cent 50.5/kWh (99Pf/kWh) but is now EUR Cent 45,7/kWh due to an automatic annual -5% ratchet built into the law. The reform raises this cap to 1,000MW. The new law benefits biofuels by exempting them from oil tax until the end of 2008. The law requires that the federal finance ministry draw up a report with the aid of other relevant ministries every two years, with the first due at the end of March 2004, to chart progress in the market introduction of biofuels, and to examine price developments of biomass, crude oil and automobile fuels. If deemed necessary, the ministry may recommend adjusting the size of the tax break for biofuels to fit the market situation. In the year 2006 the Mineral Oil Tax Law was replaced by the Energy Tax Act to comply with the Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity. With regard to taxation of biofuels the Energy Tax Act was amended by the Act on the Amendment of the Promotion of Biofuels (Gesetz zur Änderung der Förderung von Biokraftstoffen) in the year 2009.","https://www.iea.org/policies/3777-law-to-amend-the-mineral-oil-tax-law-and-renewable-energy-law",2002,NA,NA,"IEA"

Law 10438 was responsible for the creation of the Programme of Incentives for Alternative Electricity Sources (Programa de Incentivo a Fontes Alternativas de Energia Elétrica-PROINFA) among other programmes.The PROINFA programme is to be implemented in two stages:STAGE 1: 3,300 MW of renewable energy (from wind, biomass and small hydroelectric sources) will be brought on stream before the end of 2007 through a system of subsidies and incentives, which draw on an Energy Development Account funded by end-use consumers through an increase on energy bills (low-income sectors are exempt from this increase). Under the PROINFA rules, the programme will be operated by Electrobrás, which will buy energy at pre-set preferential prices (""economic values"" for each of the three sources) and will market ""renewable"" electricity. Definitive ""economic values"" will be published at the end of October 2003 and will have a reference value floor of 70% of the national average supply tariff. Contracts between Electrobrás and the ""renewable"" generator are valid for a period of 20 years, are applicable to plants that began production before 2007 and must be signed within 24 months of the publication of Law 10438. The Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES, the Brazilian National Development Bank) will make special financing programmes available for renewables projects that are eligible for PROINFA. BNDES can finance up to 70% of capital costs (excluding site acquisition and imported goods and services) at the basic national interest rates (TJLP) plus 2% of basic spread and up to 1.5% of risk spread. Interests are not charged during construction and amortization is of 10 years. Payments are due 6 months after commercial operation. Eletrobrás guarantees in the long-term electricity purchasing contracts a minimum income of 70% of the contracted energy during the financing period, as well as a full coverage to exposure risks to the short-term market PROINFA is expected to generate 150 thousand jobs and to leverage private investments of around USD 2.6 bln. Law 10762 mandates a minimum nationalization of 60% in total construction costs, as well as a regionalization criteria, where each State has maximum limits of 20% of total capacity for wind and biomass and 15% for small hydros. Such limits are preliminary: if part of the 1100 MW for each source is not contracted, this available potential will be distributed according to the older environmental permits (all projects are required to have a previous installation licence). STAGE II: Once the 3,300 MW objective has been met, PROINFA will target increasing the share of electricity produced by three renewable sources to 10% of annual consumption within 20 years.

This Act enabled the executive laws of the nine Federal Provinces to oblige grid companies to purchase electricity from CHP plants, provided that they served public district heating supply. It also stipulated that a minimum payment per kWh to be granted to CHP generated electricity serving public district heating. While the original Liberalisation Act gave the Federal Provinces full discretion in setting these rates as they chose, 2003 legislation established one CHP tariff for the entire country. However, neither the original law nor the 2002 update made provisions for the continuation of this system after 2004.

The Green Electricity Act governed the aid for green energy and combined heat and power generation throughout the country, requiring, in practice, all end consumers and electricity dealers in Austria to equally finance the aid required. The Green Electricity Act established a budget limit for CHP support in Austria based on a CHP surcharge cap imposed on electricity sold to end consumers, which was to decline from 0,15 cent/kWh in 2003 to 0,05 Cent/kWh in 2010. The CHP support tariff for 2003 and 2004 was capped at 1,5 Cent/kWh or 1,25 Cent/kWh, depending on conformity to the efficiency and district heating standards laid out in the Green Electricity Act. These CHP arrangements provided for equal treatment of all CHP plants in Austria and one harmonised CHP surcharge paid for by the end consumer throughout Austria. 2003 Evaluation: District heating (DH) and combined heat and power (CHP) plants are widespread throughout Austria, and are often instrumental in meeting the heating and power needs of medium and large cities.

Under the terms of the Electricity Reform Agreement, the price of a green certificate was presupposed to be a minimum of DKK 0.10. A penalty price for not satisfying the renewable quota was initially introduced at a price of DKK 0.27 per kWh (akin to the maximum price for a green certificate), thereby establishing a certain degree of stability of market prices. It was anticipated that the share of electricity generated from renewable sources (principally wind turbines) was expected to rise to 20% by the end of 2003. In 2001, a parliamentary hearing concluded that the renewable certificate scheme was impracticable and it has not been implemented. Until a final decision is taken, transitional regulations on power purchase rates and premium payments for renewables are set out in Executive Orders.","https://www.iea.org/policies/3470-legislation-on-electricity-favourable-to-renewables-electricity-reform-agreement",2000,NA,NA,"IEA"

The programme grants subsidies to private concessionaires who guarantee, via competitive tendering, to provide electricity to rural areas for the lowest amount of subsidies, even if off-grid options have to be implemented. The concessionaire obtains the monopoly of a given province in turn for the obligation to connect the service when requested by the customers and to maintain its continuity over the duration of the concession. PREMER (Proyecto de Energías Renovables en Mercados Rurales) concentrates on stand-alone generation systems, for scattered settlements and facilities. Consumers must cover the installation cost and provide a flat monthly rate sufficient to cover, over the 15-year concession period, approximately 40% of the initial cost in addition to expenses for maintece and batteries. Additional subsidies are provided to reduce the financial cost for the poorest members of the population, which gradually decrease during the course of the concession.

"5613","Germany","DEU",NA,NA,"Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz EEG)","This Act aims to double the share of electricity produced from renewable energy by 2010. The Act replaces the Electricity Feed-In Law of 1991. The obligation to give grid access to renewable energy plants and purchase the electricity at premium prices is shifted from the utilities to the grid operators. The tariffs are set for each individual technology, based on its actual generation cost. For an individual plant, the remuneration level stays fixed over twenty years, with the exception of wind power. A high remuneration is paid for a fixed total production of wind electricity. After reaching the limit the remuneration is decreased. The lower remuneration will be paid up to twenty 20 years after commissioning the plant. The remuneration paid for wind power on an average site is ? 0.084/kWh over a twenty-year lifetime. Since the remuneration for an individual plant is not adjusted for the inflation rate this means a decrease of remuneration in real terms. From 2002 on, the remuneration paid for newly commissioned plants has been reduced annually to provide stronger incentives for cost reductions. This factor is 5% for photovoltaic installations, 1.5% for wind power plants and 1% for biomass-fuelled plants. Since inflation is not considered, the real price decrease is higher than depicted by these rates. The Act also stipulates obligations concerning costs of grid connection and reinforcement. Plant operators have to pay for the grid connection, but the grid operator has to bear the cost of grid reinforcement if necessary. No public budgets are involved. The Act solves the problem of unequal distribution of burdens (as in the EFL) by requiring all electricity suppliers to have the same share of electricity from renewable energy in their fuel mix. For this purpose, grid operators need to balance amounts of electricity remunerated according to the Act in such a way that the share of the EEG electricity is equal on all grids on a three-month basis. Then all electricity suppliers using the public electricity grid are obliged to purchase an equal share of EEG electricity at a price equal to the average remuneration paid for all EEG electricity. This system has the effect that, not only the costs, but also the benefits, in the form of the generated electricity, are shared equally. This distribution mechanism can be characterised as an ex-post quota, where electricity suppliers know only ex-post the share of renewable energy electricity they are obliged to purchase. With this design, there is no need to calculate the ""real"" value of the electricity fed-in. On the other hand, the physical distribution of the renewable energy electricity among all suppliers gives rise to additional costs. The extra costs of regulation are not explicitly known. An additional ordice issued in 2001 specifies which biogenic substances and which technical processes are eligible for remuneration according to the Renewable Energy Sources Act. Originally, the remuneration to photovoltaic plants was limited to total capacity of 350 MW. In 2002, this cap was increased to 1000 MW. In November 2003, remuneration for photovoltaic installations was further differentiated depending on site specifics. A larger amendment came into force on 1 August 2004. Every two years, the parliament re-evaluates the Act on the basis of a report that is prepared by the Ministries of Economics and Technology, in close consultation with the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture. Please see the following table for details on the tariffs: www.iea.org/Textbase/pamsdb/renewable_table/table4.pdf","https://www.iea.org/policies/3858-renewable-energy-sources-act-erneuerbare-energien-gesetz-eeg",2000,NA,NA,"IEA"

Purchase prices are regulated. The grid operators can resell these amounts of electricity to final consumers or to electricity traders. If the minimum percentage amount is exceeded, the grid operator can sell the excess amount to other operators of distribution grids. Qualifying eco-plants include wind, PV, geothermal, biomass, biogas, digester and sewage gas, as well as co-firing and multi-fuelled plants using a high proportion of biofuels, and combustion of wastes containing a high percentage of bio materials.

Funds are allocated to relevant states and the Northern Territory on the basis of the relevant Diesel Fuel Excise paid in each jurisdiction by public generators in the years 2000-2001 to 2003-2004. At the programme start, eligibility was conditional upon applicants demonstrating that installations would displace diesel power with renewables. In December 2004, the Australian Government announced changes to the RRPGP, including: increasing eligibility for proposals to reduce any fossil fuel usage, not just diesel; expanding eligibility to include solar thermal, energy efficiency and projects on the fringe of the main grid; increasing the maximum rebate level available for some projects; and extending the deadline for expenditure of funds to 2012. Qualifying capital costs include renewable energy generation equipment, enabling/ancillary equipment (inverters, etc.) and essential expenditures such as installation costs. The programme was extended in July 2007, with the federal government designating an additional AUD 123.5 million to the programme over four years. Around AUD 328 million will be available over the life of the RRPGP.

Aimed at connecting nearly a million rural households in the three-year period from 1999-2002, Luz no Campo is the single largest rural electrification programme implemented in Brazil. Initial estimates forecasted an investment of around 1 billion dollars, that is nearly 1000 dollars per new consumer. As of September 2002, 480000 connections had been made, and another 125000 were in process. A total of 823000 new customers have signed contracts. As of 2004, no off-grid connections had been made under the programme. This could be partly be attributed to the relatively low cost of grid connections, averaging 970 dollars per connection. Rural consumers are typically expected to pay the full costs of the connection, albeit spread over a number of years. Luz-no-Campo lends 75% of the investment to concessionaires on easy terms - a 6% rate of interest, two-year grace period, and a five to ten year repayment period.

This is also applied to overseas manufacturers who export their products to Japan (“Importers”). The concept of using weighted average value is that this gives a manufacturer the option of producing both very efficient products and less efficient products for a variety of corporate reasons. This means that it leads the product market in the right direction while retaining product diversification yet still boosting energy efficiency of all the products as a whole. This is unique in this program where, in contrast to overseas requirements, Japanese standards do not preclude equipment that fails to meet the standards from the market. The Program started in 1998 with 9 products: room air conditioners, fluorescent lamps, televisions, copying machines, computers, magnetic disk units, video cassette recorders, refrigerators, passenger vehicles, and freight vehicles. The scope was reviewed every two to three years and by 2009 had gradually expanded to 21 products. As of today 23 products are included. The electricity consumed by the Top Runner targeted products sums up to more than 70% of residential electricity consumption. The current target products are as follows : passenger vehicle, freight vehicle, air conditioner, electric refrigerator, electric freezer, electric rice cooker, microwave oven, lighting equipment, electric toilet seat, TV set, video cassette recorder, DVD recorder, computer, magnetic disk unit, copying machine, space heater, gas cooking appliance, gas water heater, oil water heater, vending machine, transformer, routers, switching unit, AC motors, LED lamp, sash(window), multi-paned glazing, multi-function device, printer, electric water heater (heat pump), showcases and insulation materials.","https://www.iea.org/policies/1945-top-runner-programme",1999,NA,NA,"IEA"

In 1998, energy use of forest chips in Finland amounted to 0.5 million solid-m3. The target of the programme was to reach 2.5 million m3 by 2003. Thus, the annual use of forest chips was to increase five-fold in five years. The target was to be achieved primarily by increasing the production of chips from logging residues from regeneration areas because of their better cost competitiveness. In addition, technology was also developed to promote the energy use of small-sized trees from early thinning because of the great silvicultural benefits involved. Increasing the use of forest chips required further reduction of costs. The cost of chips made from logging residues was competitive against peat and fossil fuels in favourable conditions, but large-scale use presupposed recovery of forest fuels from more difficult stand conditions and over longer distances as well. The programme also aimed to develop quality control and storage of wood fuels. The quality of chips can be seen as a cost factor, since the energy obtained from the chips, emissions and reliability of delivery all depend upon fuel properties. Quality improvement was not confined solely to forest chips. It is just as important for the process residues from the forest industry. For this reason the scope of the programme also included bark, sawdust and other solid wood residues from the forest industry that are suitable for fuel.","https://www.iea.org/policies/3472-wood-energy-technology-programme",1999,NA,NA,"IEA"

Environment Canada also signed an agreement with ENMAX for 2 000 megawatt hours of green electricity for their electricity requirements in Alberta. Together, NRCan and Environment Canada agreements will displace more than 10 000 tonnes of CO2 annually. In 2000, NRCan signed a ten-year agreement with SaskPower, Saskatchewans electric utility and is receiving about 32 000 megawatt hours annually of wind power for its facilities in Saskatchewan. Early in 2001, NRCan signed an agreement with Maritime Electric from Prince Edward Island to purchase electricity from ERES. This ten-year agreement is for the production of 13 000 megawatt hours annually of wind power. The pilot projects in Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island will deliver about 40 000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions reductions annually. Under ""Action Plan 2000 on Climate Change"", it was expected that the federal government would purchase an additional 400 000 megawatt hours or so of electricity from ERES. Assuming a continued focus on the displacement of high-carbon electricity, these 400 000 megawatt hours would come from several provinces, particularly Nova Scotia, Ontario and New Brunswick, with additional purchases in Alberta. These purchases would result in a further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of about 200 000 tonnes annually. In 2004, the Government of Canada signed a 5-year agreement for 90 000 megawatt hours of electricity from Energy Ottawa in Ontario. New agreements are no longer being negotiated under this program. The goal of the Government purchases of electricity from ERES was to: * Provide a ""first customer"" to help interested utilities gain experience with different electricity products. * Achieve emissions reductions in federal operations. * Leverage first purchases to create viable green power markets.","https://www.iea.org/policies/3996-government-purchases-of-electricity-from-renewable-resources",1997,NA,NA,"IEA"

To enable and enhance private sector participation in the exploration, development, utilization and commercialization of OSW energy resources; c. To ensure the proper management of OSW energy resources, consistent with the countrys goals of energy self-sufficiency, affordability, and sustainable development. Executive Order 462, promulgated in 1997, strengthened the private sector?s involvement in new and renewable energy development by allowing them to launch alternative energy projects. Along the same lines as when exploration rights for fossil energy sources are awarded, in the case of renewable energies, too, a contract must be concluded with the state according to which a share of the net profits is paid to the state (""production sharing contract""). In 2000 the Programme was modified so that projects with a capacity below 1MW are exempt from the levy on net profits, and the levy is limited to 15%. The Department of Energy has also pledged to support project development and ficing, for example in the form of drawing up feasibility studies and location development.

The construction guarantee can be gradually released each time 25% of investment is executed.In tax matters, this Law mainly establishes the following benefits:Amortization of expenses incurred in the exploration stage over a period of five years, or on the basis of 'production units'.Authorization to carry accounting in foreign currency. However, only companies in the exploration stage could benefit from this benefit.Stability of the tax regime in force at the time the authorizations are granted or the concession contracts are signed.After implementation of new Regulation of the Organic Law of Geothermal Resources in April 2010, the multiple requests for authorization of geothermal rights were presented to the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM).

All retail suppliers licensed in Massachusetts must buy renewable energy certificates (RECs) produced by generating facilities that meet certain criteria. For each megawatt-hour of green electricity produced by these facilities, a REC is generated. Licensed suppliers must hold RPS-eligible RECs equivalent to a fixed percentage of the electricity that they sell to consumers each year, in megawatt-hours.

This revised tax system replaced a combined CO2 and energy tax introduced in 1994. Based on the revised tax system, electricity is taxed at its consumption stage and fuels used for power production are tax-free. Tax subsidies are paid for power production based on renewable energy sources. These subsidies were extended in 2003 to cover nearly all power production based on renewable energy sources, except for large-scale hydropower. However, in 2007 subsidies were removed from electricity produced using wood and wood-based fuels except for forest chips. Furthermore, they were removed from electricity produced with the waste gases from metallurgical processes and the reaction heat from chemical processes. Due to the changes in the operating environment caused by the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, these production types are considered competitive and therefore ineligible for subsidies. As of 1 January 2007, electricity produced through windpower, small-scale hydropower (below 1 MVA), recycled fuels, biogas and forest chips are eligible for subsidies. The tax subsidies have three levels: the subsidy for wind power and electricity produced with forest chips is Eur 0.69 (cents per kilowatt hour), that for electricity produced using recycled fuels is Eur 0.25 per kWh and the subsidy for others is Eur 0.42 per kWh.","https://www.iea.org/policies/3936-tax-subsidies-for-power-production-based-on-renewable-energy-sources",1997,NA,NA,"IEA"

This ""green electricity"" entered the market as a new product which could be purchased instead of electricity generated in conventional plants. Most utilities and electricity suppliers offer a choice between tariffs to their customers. The choice to purchase green electricity, may even be differentiated between the different sources of renewable energy (e.g. 100% hydropower). Such programmes do not necessarily lead to the installment of new capacity (This is due to the fact that electricity from existing renewable energy plants will have to first enter the market). Once feasible conditions are established, new capacity is installed. The dissemination of such offers into the German market can be split in two phases surrounding the liberalisation of the electricity market in 1998; the first prior to liberalisation and the second after. In the initial phase, prior to the liberalisation, utilities commercialised green power supplies by requesting green tariffs. Electricity was sold with a surcharge the utility used to build up funds which were used for installing new renewable energy capacity, mainly photovoltaic systems. The utility could pass the financial burden on to electricity customers. After the deregulation of the market, independent electricity suppliers also started to market green power. In 2000, 132 different companies offered green electricity. The market share, however, was less than 1% of the total power supply. Several certification schemes exist to ensure independent monitoring and control of the electricity?s origin. Moreover, some of these certification schemes also monitor whether the funds are invested in new plants. Although not being a governmental programme, the state has supported green power in two ways: before liberalisation, regulatory authorities accepted extra costs caused by green tariffs and after the market liberalisation, state agencies began to purchase green power.","https://www.iea.org/policies/4061-green-power",1996,NA,NA,"IEA"

Electricity distributors following a recommendation by the Electricity and Gas Control Committee, devote BEF 0.01 per kWh sold to activities in the field of RUE. In all three regions the fund is used for promotional activities aimed at four target audiences: households, industry (inclusive of agri- and horticulture), the tertiary sector and the municipalities.  Promotional activities include premiums and support measures for energy audits, thermal solar energy investments, installation of heat pumps and solar boilers, relighting measures, installation of condensation boilers and CHP units, and other energy efficiency measures. Electricity producers A fund for RUE also exists in the electricity production sector.  Activities undertaken in 1999 include the second phase of a study of the sector's potential to reduce GHG emissions, projects in the field of renewable energy and the promotion of CHP. Concerning energy demand, BEF 20 million was spent on energy audits and BEF 22.7 million on technological assistance. At its meeting on 5 April 2000, the Federal Council of Ministers decided that the RUE fund be increased to BEF 1 billion and that its management should be more transparent and efficient.

"5710","Denmark","DNK",NA,NA,"Green Tax Package 1995","Based on the Green Tax Package 1995, provided for reform of the tax system between 1996 and 2000. It contained four principal elements: - three tax elements consisting of an energy tax, a CO2 tax and an SO2 tax; - a distinction between three different purposes for energy use when assessing the tax: space heating, light industrial processes and heavy industrial processes; - provisions for a significantly reduced tax rate in the case of specific energy-intensive activities, conditional upon a business committing itself to reducing energy consumption through an agreement negotiated between the company and the Danish Energy Agency (if the company did not fulfil the agreement, reimbursements already paid had to be returned and the tax imposed in full); and - gradual phase-in of the taxes. A large part of the additional revenues from the Green Tax Package were transferred back to enterprises through reduced taxation on employing labour and reductions in employers social security contributions. A smaller share was redirected to the industry and service sectors to provide investment grants for energy efficiency measures. These grants could be up to 30% of the initial outlay on a project with a payback period of between two and nine years. About DKK 1.8 billion (Eur 242 million) was set aside for these subsidies (capital grants) for 1996-2000. The Danish Energy Agency (now the Danish Energy Authority) established a list of 40 standard solutions for energy efficiency improvements and determined which projects would qualify. Eligible projects had to increase energy efficiency, reduce CO2 or SO2 emissions or be of a developmental character. Companies could also suggest individual solutions. Applications for support rose from 2,800 in 1996 to 7,000 in 2000. In an evaluation carried out in 1999, the government estimated that the Green Tax Package 1995 resulted in a net decrease of the overall tax burden by DKK 335 million and that CO2 emissions from industry in 2005 would be reduced by 3.8%, corresponding to 2.3 million tonnes1. Half of this was due to the taxes and the rest to subsidy and voluntary agreement schemes. In the case of the CO2 tax, the difference between the tax rate with and without voluntary agreements grew significantly between 1996 and 2001. EARLIER HISTORY OF ENERGY TAXATION IN DENMARK: Taxation of energy products has a long history in Denmark, dating back to the first tax on petrol introduced in 1917. As of 1980, taxation of a large number of products through the economy was motivated in part by environmental considerations and to save resources, especially energy. Energy taxes comprise taxes and duties on carbon dioxide, sulphur, electricity, natural gas, petrol and specific petroleum products. In 1991, energy taxes were reformed into an energy and carbon tax to reflect Denmarks environmental concerns. A large share of the tax revenues was used for energy efficiency measures and since the tax system came into effect in 1992 it has been expanded. Denmark embarked on a green tax reform to shift the tax burden away from income and towards resource use. This system was put into place between 1994 and 1998. Energy taxes were raised progressively, particularly on coal and electricity consumption, leading to an average increase in taxation on heating and power of 30% from 1994 to 1998. The main effect was that households paid lower income taxes and higher environmental taxes.","https://www.iea.org/policies/2202-green-tax-package-1995",1995,NA,NA,"IEA"
