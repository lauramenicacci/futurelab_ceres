Package for the future – Mobility,https://www.iea.org/policies/13481-package-for-the-future-mobility,"Germany wants to strengthen mobility while ensuring greater sustainability and climate protection. To this end, the mobility part of the Package for the future will implement the following measures:  - Improve the vehicle tax (Kfz-Steuer für Pkw) for passenger cars in order to steer demand towards lower-emissions or emission-free vehicles. For new registrations since 1 January 2021, the vehicle tax will be based on CO2 emissions per km, and will be higher for vehicles above the 95g CO2/km threshold. The ten-year vehicle tax exemption for the purchase of electric vehicles will be granted and extended until the end of the year 2030.  - Implement an environmental premium to replace old motor vehicle fleet with electric vehicles. The already existing premium will be doubled thanks to the new ""innovation premium"". In addition, the measure on 0.25% taxation of purely electric company cars, the purchase price limit will be increased from €40 000 to €60 000.Budget forecasted: €2.2 billion - Create a bonus programme for 2020 and 2021 for car manufacturers and industry suppliers, to incite innovation thanks to new investments. Research and development for relevant technologies will receive a €1 billion fund in 2020 and 2021. Budget forecasted : €2 billion - Launch the ""Social & Mobile"" programme in 2020 and 2021 to promote electromobility and support non-profit users to convert their vehicle fleet. Budget forecasted: €200 million - Create a temporary fleet replacement programme for craftsmen and SMEs to encourage their transition to electric vehicles.Budget unknown - Develop modern and safe charging points, and expand existing charging point networks and infrastructures to make them more accessible (gas stations, hospitals, sports facilities, etc.)Budget forecasted: €2.5 billion - Continue to support the German railway company Deutsche Bahn to encourage the modernisation, expansion and electrification of the rail network. The Federal Government will contribute 1 billion euros of additional equity to Deutsche Bahn each year from 2020 to 2030. To compensate for the fall in revenues due to the Covid-19 pandemic, €5 billion of additional equity capital will be provided.  - Additional €150 million will be used to improve mobile radio reception along the 39,000 km of railway lines in Germany (conversion to GSM-R).Budget forecasted: €150 million - The ""Bus and Truck Fleet Modernisation Programme"" will promote alternative eco-friendly vehicles (e.g. e-buses). Funding for e-buses and their charging infrastructure will also be increased until the end of the year 2021. Budget forecasted: €1.2 billion  - The German government will demand the EU Commission to set up a temporary Europe-wide fleet renewal programme 2020-21. It will concern heavy-duty commercial vehicles for the purchase of trucks with the latest Euro 6 emissions standard. The government asks for a subsidy of 15,000 euros for the replacement of Euro 5 trucks and 10,000 euros for the replacement of Euro 3 or Euro 4 vehicles. Budget forecasted: unknown - Shipping will be modernised and digitalised as a climate-friendly means of transport. Germany will encourage bank rehabilitation, modernisation of locks, replacement of ships and digital test fields. €1 billion will be provided to structures and innovation programmes such as the Maritime Research Programme, the Shore Power Funding Programme, the ""LNG Refuelling Vessel Funding Programme"", the ""Fleet Renewal Programme for Authority Ships"" and a new ""Clean Ship Immediate Programme"". Budget forecasted: €1 billion - Support to convert aircraft fleets to modern aircraft emitting up to 30% less CO² and noise. Budget forecasted: €1 billion",Undefined,18 March 2022,https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/EN/Standardartikel/Topics/Public-Finances/Articles/2020-06-04-fiscal-package.html,Energy Efficiency|Electrification|Technology R&D and innovation,"Strategic plans|Payments, finance and taxation|Taxes, fees and charges|Payments and transfers|Targets|Framework legislation|Targets, plans and framework legislation|Finance",Transport|Road transport|Economy-wide (Multi-sector)|Rail transport|Air transport|Water transport,Undefined,Undefined,Germany,2020,In force,National,DEU

"Bonus-malus system for passenger cars, light trucks and light buses",https://www.iea.org/policies/2844-bonus-malus-system-for-passenger-cars-light-trucks-and-light-buses,"The Government and Parliament have decided on a bonus malus system for new passenger cars class I and II (motorhomes), light buses and light trucks. When it comes to Class II passenger cars, there is no upper limit on the total weight. The amendment applies from July 1, 2018 and only affects new vehicles registered in the Road Traffic Register as of that date. Only new class I and II passenger cars, light buses and light trucks are affected by bonus malus. When it comes to Class II passenger cars, there is no upper limit on the total weight. The vehicle tax remains unchanged for the cars rolling on the roads today. By new is meant vehicles that become taxable (taken into traffic) for the first time on July 1, 2018 or later. (The vehicle must not have been parked before, either in Sweden or abroad.) For malus, the car also has vehicle year 2018 or later. Bonus - for cars with low emissions: Environmentally adapted vehicles with relatively low carbon dioxide emissions of up to 60 g / km, are rewarded with a bonus of a maximum of SEK 60,000. Malus - increased vehicle tax: Malus means an increased vehicle tax during the first three years for petrol and diesel class I and II passenger cars, light buses and light trucks. The system entails the following changes: 1. The five-year vehicle tax exemption for environmental cars is removed. The vehicles that currently have a five-year tax exemption are not affected. But no new cars will be exempt from tax after the bonus malus has come into force.2. The super-environment car premium is replaced by a bonus for so-called climate bonus cars with low emissions.3. For petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles with vehicle year 2018 or later, an increased vehicle tax - malus - is levied during the first three years from the time the vehicle becomes taxable (taken into traffic) for the first time on July 1, 2018 or later.4. For diesel-powered vehicles that are put into service for the first time on or after July 1, 2018, the fuel factor is replaced with a fuel supplement.
